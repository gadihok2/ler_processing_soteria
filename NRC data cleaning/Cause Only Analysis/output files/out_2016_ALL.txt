2472016001|1|TITLE|1|: Technical Specification Prohibited Condition Caused by One Main Steam Safety Valve
2472016001|2|ABSTRACT|1|(  ) On March 4, 2016, during the performance of surveillance procedure 2-PT-R006, Main Steam Safety Valve (MSSV) MS-45B failed to lift within the Technical Specification (TS) as- ' found required range of +/- 3% of the setpoint pressure. Valve MS-45B lifted at 1125 psig, 29 psig outside its acceptance range of 1034 to 1096 psig and 5.7% above its 1065 psig setpoint. The valve was declared inoperable, then subsequently restored to operability upon two successful lifts within the required setpoint range without the need for adjustment. Nine other MSSVs that were tested lifted within the as-found required setpoint range. The apparent cause for the failure was internal friction due to spindle rod wear, which causes the spindle rod to bind against internal components. 
2472016001|3|DESCRIPTION|1|On March 4, 2016 at 1116 hours, while at approximately 79 percent power, during surveillance testing of the Main Steam Safety Valves (MSSV) in accordance with procedure 2-PT-R006, MSSV MS-45B on Steam Generator (SG) 22 failed to lift within the-Technical Specification (TS) as-found required range of +/- 3% of the required setpoint pressure. Valve MS-45B lifted at 1125 psig, 29 psig outside its setpoint range of 1034 to 1096 psig and 5.7% above its 1065 psig setpoint. Consequently, MS-45B was declared inoperable and Technical Specification (TS) 3.7.1 (Main Steam Safety Valves) Condition A was entered. Two immediate subsequent tests were performed without any adjustments required and the valve lifted at 1038 psig and 1037 psig. With the valve lifting within the required setpoint range, the valve was restored to operability, allowing exit from the TS 3.7.1 Action Statement at 1126 hours. During the surveillance test, nine (9) other MSSVs that were tested passed their-as-found test criteria and were left within the +/- 1% set point criteria. The failure of MS-45B was recorded in the Indian Point Energy Center (IPEC) 
2472016001|4|CAUSE|1|The apparent cause for the failure was internal friction due to spindle rod wear, which causes the spindle rod to bind against internal components. High vibrations of the spindle rod caused friction between the rod, spring washer, and adjusting bolt. The vibration of the spindle rod while in contact with the spring washer and adjusting bolt resulted in severe wear in the form of steps on the spindle rod. The resulting frictional force occurs on the first lift and then does not repeat. The vendor's solution to the problem is to install sacrificial bronze wear sleeves along the inner diameter of the spindle rod contact points (inner diameters of the adjusting bolt, upper spring washer, and lower spring washer). The spring washers and adjusting bolt are machined to accept the bronze wear sleeves, which act as a sacrificial metal, preventing spindle wear and step formation. One-sleeve is installed in each of the spring washers and two sleeves are installed in the adjusting bolt. An extent of condition (EOC) was performed to determine where potential conditions with similar valves, design, systems, and environments could occur. The review determined that the EOC found in the failure of MS-45B is restricted to the other 19 MSSVs at Unit 2 and the 20 MSSVs at Unit 3 due to the excluive valve design. All MSSVs are exposed to high vibrations during their operating cycle during which wear can occur. Previous failures of MSSVs have included wear due to spring skewing and -setpoint drift.' Spring skewing can occur in any of the MSSVs and cause side loading frictional forces which prevent the valve from lifting. Setpoint drift can occur due to age of the components and the operating cycle it is exposed to (e.g., changes in temperature, pressure and vibrations). PAST SIMILAR S A-review was performed of LicenseeEVent Reports (LERs) for any events reporting TS prohibited conditions due to MSSV test failures.2010-002 reported two MSSV failures, one due to valve spring skew and the other due to setpoint drift. 2012-005 reported one MSSV outside the required as-found lift setpoint range due to spring skew/spindle wear. The MSSVs at Unit 2 are the same as those at Unit 3, and LERs have reported MSSV test failures at Unit 3. LER-2011-004 reported two MSSVs outside the required as-found lift setpoint ranges due to spindle wear and spring skew. LER-2013-001 reported two MSSVs outside the required as-found lift setpoint ranges due to galling around the circumference of the spindle rod as a result of vibration for one valve, and internal friction caused by foreign material between the guide bearing and spindle for the other valve.2015-002 reported three MSSVs outside the required as-found lift setpoint ranges due to internal friction from spindle rod vibration.

2472016002|2|ABSTRACT|1|(  ) On March 7, 2016, while performing set-up activities for 2-PT-R084C, "23 EDG 8 Hour Load Test," the normal supply breaker to 480 Volt AC Bus (ED) 3A tripped on overcurrent. This caused 480 Volt AC Buses 3A and 6A to de-energize since, as part of the test set-up activities, the tie breaker (3AT6A) between Buses 3A and 6A was closed and the normal supply breaker for Bus 6A was opened. This resulted in a loss of both 21 and 22 Residual Heat Removal (RHR) {BP} pumps. As 'designed, all Emergency Diesel Generators  (EDGs) {EK} received automatic initiation signals to start. All required 480 Volt AC buses automatically re-energized by design, with the exception of Bus 3A, which had an overcurrent lockout. Operators manually started 22 RHR pump to restore RHR cooling. However, prior to restoring the normal supply power to Bus 3A, 23 EDG tripped on overcurrent which resulted in a second loss of RIM event. The cause for the Bus 3A supply breaker tripping was inadequate procedural guidance resulting in excessive loads being energized on Buses 3A and 6A. The direct cause for 23 EDG tripping was cracked solder joints on the automatic voltage regulator (AVR). 
2472016002|3|DESCRIPTION|1|(If more space is required, use additional copies of NRC Form 366A) (17) Note: The Energy Industry Identification System Codes are identified within the brackets {}. DESCRIPTION On March 7, 2016 at approximately 10:18 hours, with Indian Point Unit 2 in Cold Shutdown, Mode 5, Operations test personnel were performing set-up activities for surveillance procedure 2-PT-R084C, "23 EDG 8 Hour Load Test," when the normal supply breaker to 480 Volt AC Bus {ED} 3A tripped on overcurrent. This caused both 480 Volt AC Buses 3A and 6A to de-energize since, as part of the load test set-up activities, the tie breaker (3AT6A) between Buses 3A and 6A was required to be closed and the normal supply breaker for Bus 6A was required to be opened. The 8-hour load test was designed such that 23 EDG would power the loads on 480 Volt AC Buses 3A and 6A simultaneously. Approximately 14 minutes after cross-tying Bus 3A to Bus 6A and opening the Bus 6A normal supply breaker, the normal supply breaker to Bus 3A tripped on overcurrent. This resulted in a loss of assigned loads for both Bus 3A and 6A including 21 and 22 Residual Heat Removal (RHR) {BP} pumps, and 21 Spent Fuel Pool (SFP) {DA} pump. Technical Specification LCO 3.4.7 requires one RHR loop to be operable and in operation, and either the non-operating RHR to be operable and capable of being powered, or the secondary side water level in at least two steam generators to be greater than or equal to 0-percent narrow range. Technical Specification 3.4.7 Condition C was entered and operations personnel immediately initiated actions to restore one RHR loop to operation. There were no SSCs that were inoperable at the beginning of the event which contributed to the event. As designed, 21, 22, and 23 Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs) {EK} received automatic engineered safety feature (ESF) start signals because of the loss of voltage on 480 Volt AC Bus 6A. As part of the load test set-up activities 23 EDG had already been running, although not tied to Bus 6A yet. At the time that both RHR pumps were de-energized, 24 Reactor Coolant Pump (RCP) {AB} was in operation and providing forced circulation in the reactor coolant system. The Main Steam System {SB} was available and the steam generators were coupled (i.e. pressurizer level and steam generator levels were adequate) thus decay heat removal was never lost. All 480 Volt AC buses re-energized automatically by design, with the exception of Bus 3A. Bus 3A had an overcurrent lockout that prevented 22 EDG from automatically loading onto the bus. At approximately 10:19, 22 RHR pump was started to restore RHR cooling. This event was recorded in the Indian Point Energy Center 
2472016002|4|CAUSE|1|The direct cause of the event that occurred on March 7, 2016 at approximately 10:18 hours was a loss of power to 480 Volt Bus 3A when the normal supply breaker from Station Service Transformer (SST-3) tripped on overcurrent due to excessive loads energized on Bus 3A and Bus 6A. As designed, this caused the 480 Volt AC buses to strip loads, resulting in the loss of both 21 and 22 RHR Pumps, 21 SFP Pump, lighting and various other loads. The apparent cause was inadequate guidance in 2-PT-R084C resulting in excessive loads energized on Buses 3A and 6A. Procedure 2-PT-R084C contained a precaution and limitation to limit current on the 3AT6A cross tie breaker but contained no guidelines on limiting current on the Bus 3A normal supply breaker (i.e. breaker overcurrent trip point was listed but this was for information only and there are no meters where this current can be read). At the time, SST-3 was carrying approximately 260 amps. Procedure 2-PT-R084C was subsequently revised to include a precaution and limitation to maintain SST loads less than 200 amps. The direct cause for the second transient that occurred on March 7, 2016 at approximately 11:32 hours was determined to be cracked solder connections on the 23 EDG AVR circuit card. Following a microscopic inspection of the solder joints for the magnetic amplifier by the vendor, it was determined that all nine terminals for the Ll magnetic amplifier exhibited solder cracking. Based upon the cyclic heating and cooling of the Ll magnetic amplifier, it was concluded that thermal growth of the Ll magnetic amplifier relative to the card could have caused cyclic stress on the solder joints. TherefOre, thermally-induced stress is the most likely cause of the solder joint cracks. The apparent cause was the failure to establish a PM strategy in accordance with a Part 21 notification and vendor's maintenance bulletin for the AVR card defect. Based on the intermittent nature of this failure in addition to elimination of all remaining potential causes, it is with high confidence that the cause for the overcurrent trip event which occurred on March 7, 2016 was the result of the intermittent symptoms associated with the degraded connections on the AVR assembly. This condition was recorded in the Indian Point Energy Center

2472016004|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   During a scheduled refueling outage that commenced on March 7, 2016, an inspection of the reactor vessel internals that is required by MRP-227-A was performed. As a result of the inspection, 227 baffle-former bolts were identified to have either visual anomalies or ultrasonic indications or could not be examined by ultrasonic testing. A visual inspection of the baffle-former plates and edge bolts showed no discernible material degradation or distortion. All other MRP-227-A inspections of the reactor vessel internals showed no other failures or premature degradation. The root cause of the failed baffle-former bolts is primarily Irradiation Assisted Stress Corrosion Cracking (IASCC) in combination with applied stresses and fatigue loads. Failure analyses will be conducted to confirm the cause for the degradation - of the baffle-former bolts.

DESCRIPTION Indian Point Unit 2 (IP2) was shut down as scheduled on March 7th, 2016 to implement the 2R22 refueling outage. As part of the IP2 License Renewal process, Entergy committed to performing inspections of the reactor vessel internal components {AB} during the 2R22 refueling outage. The NRC has approved EPRI Technical Report MRP-227-A, "Materials Reliability Program: Pressurized Water Reactor Internals Inspection and Evaluation Guidelines," as an acceptable vehicle for performing aging-related inspections and evaluations of applicable reactor components. One set of components inspected under MRP-227-A were the baffle-former bolts through visual inspection (VT) and ultrasonic (UT) examination. The IP2'baffle structure includes 832 baffle-former bolts which attach the baffle plates, to the former plates. Of the 832 baffle-former bolts, 227 either failed to meet acceptance criteria or could not be UT inspected. The UT inspection identified indications on 182 bolts, 14 were incapable of being UT inspected and were thus conservatively assumed to have failed, and 31 bolts failed the VT. The failed baffle-former bolts are distributed throughout the vertical baffle plates with more failures found in the upper portion of the plates and more concentrated on some of the plates than others (the failures are clustered). The 227 failed bolts and the pattern of failure did not meet the acceptance criteria for plant startup from the 2R22 refueling outage which had been provided by Westinghouse prior to the outage in an analysis of the baffle-former assembly in WCAP-18048-P. The consequence of this is that baffle-former bolt replacements were required to be completed prior to returning IP2 back to service. The reactor vessel (RV) {RPV} is cylindrical in shape with a hemispherical bottom and a flanged and gasketed (0-rings) removable upper head. The vessel contains the reactor core, the core support structures, control rod clusters {AA}, thermal shield, and other components. The RV Lower Internal Assembly provides support for the core and channels reactor coolant flow through the fuel assemblies {AC}. The main element of the Lower Internals Assembly is the core barrel, which is a cylindrical structure fabricated from welded plate that is supported at its upper flange by a ledge in the RV main flange. The core barrel includes the baffle-former assembly, which is bolted directly to the lower core barrel. This stainless steel assembly is a bolted configuration consisting of eight (8) horizontal former plates and twenty-eight (28) vertical baffle plates which provide the transition from the cylindrical core barrel to a geometry that accepts rectangular fuel assemblies. The assembly forms a boundary for the flow of reactor coolant and provides some lateral support for the fuel assemblies for both normal and abnormal operation.

On March 9, 2016, during shutdown for a refueling outage, while performing testing of the safety injection (SI) system, the Station Auxiliary Transformer (SAT) Load Tap Changer (LTC) failed to increase per design upon actuation of an SI signal. The condition was acceptable for the current mode but is unacceptable when the offsite AC electric power distribution and SI System is required to be operable. An investigation was performed and it was discovered on March 28, 2016, that the SAT control cabinet terminal blocks W105 and W106 had their links open thereby preventing proper operation of the LTC. A review of tests and Work Orders (WO) did not identify any previous failed tests or any WO with instructions to open the links. The last successful test of LTC operation was performed on February 26, 2014. The direct cause of the event was open links for the SAT LTC SI signal. The most probable apparent cause was maintenance activities by either IPEC or supplemental personnel that left the SAT states links W105 and W106 open during the 2014 spring outage (2R21). A review was performed of 42 Work Order (WO) tasks conducted during the 2014 spring outage. None of the WO tasks required work on the SAT LTC links or required work in the specific area of the states links.

On March 9, 2016, during shutdown for a refueling outage, while performing testing of the safety injection (SI) system, the Station Auxiliary Transformer (SAT) Load Tap Changer (LTC) failed to increase per design upon actuation of an SI signal. The condition was acceptable for the current mode but is unacceptable when the offsite AC electric power distribution and SI System is required to be operable. An investigation was performed and it was discovered on March 28, 2016, that the SAT control cabinet terminal blocks W105 and W106 had their links open thereby preventing proper operation of the LTC. A review of tests and Work Orders (WO) did not identify any previous failed tests or any WO with instructions to open the links. The last successful test of LTC operation was performed on February 26, 2014. The direct cause of the event was open links for the SAT LTC SI signal. The most probable apparent cause was maintenance activities by either IPEC or supplemental personnel that left the SAT states links W105 and W106 open during the 2014 spring outage (2R21). A review was performed of 42 Work Order (WO) tasks conducted during the 2014 spring outage. None of the WO tasks required work on the SAT LTC links or required work in the specific area of the states links.

2472016008|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   On November 30, 2015, a leak was discovered on Service Water (SW) weld F-1924, which joins a cement-lined carbon steel elbow to a Copper/Nickel (Cu/Ni) Heat Exchanger pipe nozzle on the 21 Component Cooling Water Heat Exchanger. Code case N-513-3 was applied to the pipe defect to justify, continued operability and preparations initiated for a weld repair during the upcoming spring refueling outage (RO) starting March 7, 2016. 'On. March 19, 2016, weld repair was performed on the weld F-1924 and satisfactory non- destructive examination was completed. On June 12, 2016, a new leak was discovered in the same SW pipe repair area. During the subsequent repair, cracking was experienced in the ERCuNi filler metal which extended the duration of the repair and forced a Unit shutdown to comply with the TS 72 hour AOT. The direct cause was recurring longitudinal solidification cracks that developed during welding of copper-nickel to carbon steel pipe. The apparent cause was that the team assigned to prepare and execute the weld repair plan failed to ensure all risks and issues were.identified and managed properly. Key 
2472016008|3|DESCRIPTION|1|Note: The Energy Industry Identification System Codes are identified within the brackets {}. DESCRIPTION On November 30, 2015, a 1 drop per second leak was discovered on Service Water (SW) {BI} weld F-1924 on SW line #411, which joins a carbon steel elbow to a 90/10 Copper/Nickel (Cu/Ni) Heat Exchanger {HX} pipe nozzle on the 21 Component Cooling Water (CCW) {CC} Heat Exchanger {HX}. In accordance with Generic Letter 89-13 program guidance and ASME Code case N-513-3 the weld was evaluated and determined acceptable but required to be repaired prior to start-up from the 2016 spring refueling outage (RO) (2R22). The degradation mechanism leading to the leak was likely crevice corrosion. Leakage was seen to emanate at the weld toe, on the carbon steel side. The leak was recorded in Indian Point Energy Center (IPEC)  program (CAP) as CR-IP2-2015-05358 and repairs scheduled to be performed during the upcoming spring refueling outage (RO) starting March 7, 2016. The copper-nickel to carbon steel weld joints in the CCW to SW piping are the only known welds on site with this configuration. A flaw characterization and full pipe circumference examination of this weld found that the leak was a localized area of corrosion. Another area of thinning at one other circumferential location on the same weld was identified, but the weld thickness in that area met minimum wall thickness requirements and was designated for continued monitoring with no immediate action necessary. To support the weld repair plan, from December 17, 2015 to February 8,.2016, a draft Entergy Welding Procedure Specification (WPS) was developed for welding P34 90/10 copper-nickel base material to P1 carbon steel base material. ERNiCu7 was chosen as the filler metal. Two separate weld test coupons were prepared to qualify the procedure and were shipped to the weld test lab (Lucius Pitkin Inc.) for procedure qualification testing. Test results were obtained on March 3, 2016, which showed one of the four bend tests failed due to inclusions in the root of the weld joint resulting in a failure to qualify the procedure. On March 4, 2016, vendors are contacted to determine if they have a qualified welding procedure for copper-nickel to carbon steel. Only one vendor (Westinghouse PCI) had a qualified procedure using the ERCuNi filler metal. Due to the limited time available to repeat the procedure qualification testing prior to scheduled work, the weld repair was contracted to the vendor with the approved qualified procedure for welding P34 90/10 copper-nickel to P1 carbon steel using the ERCuNi filler metal. On March 7, 2016, the Unit 2 Refueling Outage (RO) started. Repairs to the 21 CCW Heat Exchanger SW line #411 pinhole leak were scheduled to be performed on March 18 through March 19, 2016. On March 19, 2016, weld repairs, including excavation, weld build-up, and post-repair non-destructive examination (NDE) of the flaw on weld F-1924 was completed. On June 4, 2016, a In-service Leak Test (ISLT) of the SW system was completed satisfactorily. No leaks identified.
2472016008|4|CAUSE|1|The direct cause was recurring longitudinal solidification cracks that developed during welding of copper-nickel to carbon steel pipe. The primary degradation mechanism leading to the November '30, 2015 leak Was likely crevice corrosion, caused by small holidays in the internal coating at the field weld that allowed SW to contact the internal piping base metal. The corrosion promoted thinning in the affected area, which resulted in the development of a pin hole at the weakened toe of the carbon steel elbow to copper-nickel inlet nozzle field weld on the carbon steel. Surface exams performed during the RO repairs did not identify any defects. However, potential subsurface flaws would not be detected using the surface exam technique. During the RO and the June 2016 post outage repair work, repairs to the leaking indication initially used ERCuNi filler metal to restore the weld integrity. This method resulted in strain-induced longitudinal cracking in the highly restrained joint due to the relatively low tensile strength of the material, its thermal conductivity differences with carbon steel, and its susceptibility to iron dilution from steel, which can increase the tendency for brittle fracture. Standard industry practices to reduce cracking tendencies prior to joining dissimilar metals with filler material were not identified in the repair plan.

2472016009|1|TITLE|1|: Automatic Reactor Trip Due to Actuation of the Trip Logic of the Reactor Protection
2472016009|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   On July 6, 2016,Instrument and Control (I) technicians were preparing to perform 2-PT-2M3A (RPS Logic Train B Actuation Logic Test and Tadot). Prior to starting the test, the I technicians were unable to locate key #184 that was identified in the test as associated with the reactor trip breaker B bypass key switch. Control Room staff recommended obtaining key #183 associated with reactor trip breaker A bypass key switch to use in lieu of key #184. To ensure the key would work prior to starting the test, the train B bypass key switch was positioned by an I technician to the Defeat position. Because reactor trip Bypass Breaker B was in the racked out position, when the key switch was taken to the Defeat position, it caused the normal Reactor Trip Breaker B to open, which initiated a reactor trip (RT) and auxiliary feed water system actuation. The direct cause was an I technician turned the key interlock to defeat on switchgear Channel B Reactor Protection Logic without having the BYB Bypass breaker racked in and closed.

2472016009|3|DESCRIPTION|1|Note: The Energy Industry Identification System Codes are identified within the brackets {1. DESCRIPTION On July 6, 2016,while at 100 percent reactor power, preparations were in progress to commence a scheduled bi-monthly surveillance test in accordance with 2-PT-2M3A [RPS Logic Train B Actuation Logic Test and TADOT (>25% Reactor Power)]. The purpose of the surveillance is to perform actuation logic testing of the Reactor Protection System {JC} logic Train B in accordance with Technical Specification (TS) 3.3.1 (Reactor Protection System Instrumentation) Table 3.3.1-1, Function 20, Surveillance Requirement 3.3.1.5. The test had been originally scheduled for June 30, 2016, but due to concerns about Battery Changer 22 grounds, the test was re-scheduled for the following week., At approximately 07:30 hours, on July 6, 2016, a pre-job briefing was held with four I technicians and the I job Supervisor. Subsequent to the briefing, the I technicians went to the Control Room {NA} and informed the Control Room Supervisor (CRS) of the test and what to expect. In the prerequisites section of 2-PT-2M3A, the breaker interlock key number 182, 184 or equivalent was to be obtained from operations prior to commencing the test. At approximately 9:15 hours, I personnel determined neither key number 182 nor key number 184 could be found in the Control Room key locker. The CRS suggested that the Train A key number 183 could be used as an equivalent because it was believed that both trains were keyed the same. Due to concerns with the short Technical Specification (TS) 8-hour Allowed Outage Time (AOT) for the test the I technicians wanted to ensure the key would work prior to entering the TS ing Condition for Operation (LCO) and starting the test and discussed it with the CRS. The key concerns were discussed with the CRS. After a brief discussion, the I technicians believed that Operations gave them permission to test the key prior to starting the surveillance test. Operations believed that the I technicians would test the key during the surveillance. At approximately 9:30 hours, two of the I technicians, one operator and two Nuclear Plant Operator (NPOs) took key number 183 (designated for Train A) to the location of the Reactor Trip Breakers (RTBs) {BKR}(Cable Spreading Room) {NA}. The 8-hour TS LCO was not entered. Two non-licensed operators (NPOs) were present in the Cable Spreading Room to rack in the bypass breaker when requested by the I technicians. The Field Shift Supervisor (FSS) was also there to inspect cables that were utilized with the Rod Drop Testing during the recent outage. One of the I technicians called the Control Room and told another I technician, who was staged in the Control Room, that they would receive an annunciator on Panel SK, Window 2-5. The Control Room operator acknowledged the alert of an expected alarm and the I technician in the Control Room relayed the acknowledgement to the I technician in the Cable Spreading Room containing the RTBs.

Event• On April 15, 2000, with the Unit 3 Reactor in Mode 3 (hot shutdown), in accordance with Abnormal Operating Instruction (A01) 3-A0I-100-1, Reactor Scram, Operations checked to ensure surveillances 3-SR-3.3.1.2.5&6, Source Range Monitor Functional Test With Reactor Mode Switch Not in Run Position, and 3-SR-3.3.1.2.7 (A, B, C, and D), Source Range Monitor (SRM) [IG] Calibration and Functional test, were in their periodicity. From the check, it was determined that 3-SR-3.3.1.2.5&6 was out of the periodicity, and on April 15, 2000, at 1426 hours CDT, Operations commenced performance of the surveillance. The surveillance was successfully completed by 1761 hours CDT, and SRMs A, B, and D were declared operable. Source Range Monitor C was inoperable prior to the scram. TSs require only two channels to be operable when in Mode 3. Thus, the operators considered the minimum required channels to be operable with C channel inoperable. On April 16, 2000, at 0820 hours CDT, the Unit 3 Operators commenced Surveillance 3-SR-3.10.2, Verification of Surveillance Requirements For Reactor Mode Switch Interlock Testing. This was in anticipation of performing Surveillance 3-SR-3.3.1.1.12, Reactor Protection System Mode Switch in Shutdown Scram and Logic System Functional Test. Surveillance 3-SR-3.10.2 requires that the operators verify that all control rods located in core cells containing one or more fuel assemblies are fully inserted and, there are no core alterations in progress. The requirements of 3-SR-3.10.2 were subsequently verified to be complete. On April 16, 2000, at approximately 0835 hours CDT, the plant operators commenced performance of Surveillance 3-SR-3.3.1.1.12. This test required moving the reactor mode switch [XIS][JE] out of shutdown. The test on the reactor mode switch was completed satisfactorily at approximately 1225 hours CDT. On April 17, 2000, at approximately 1735 hours CDT, operators determined that 3-SR-3.3.1.2.4, Source Range Monitor System Count Rate and Signal to Noise Ratio Check, had not been performed as required. The SR was commenced and successfully completed at approximately 2235 hours for SRMs A, B, and D. Following the successful completion of 3-SR-3.3.1.2.4 on April 17, 2000, the NRC Resident Inspector questioned TVA's implementation of the TS requirements for TS LCO 3.3.1.2, Condition D, and TS LCO 3.10.2. This condition was not considered reportable as a missed surveillance since the actions for inoperable SRMs (Mode switch in Shutdown and all insertable control rods inserted) had been met since the reactor scram. TVA's response to the resident inspector was that TS LCO 3.10.2

NO X On April 15, 2000, at 1226 hours Central Daylight time (CDT), Unit 3 received an automatic reactor scram from 70 percent power. Following the scram, the reactor mode switch was placed in the shutdown position. On April 16, 2000, at 0835 hours CDT, plant operators commenced performance of surveillance Reactor Protection System Mode Switch in Shutdown Scram and Logic System Functional Test. This test requires that the mode switch be moved out of the shutdown position. On April 17, 2000, at approximately 1735 hours CDT, following satisfactory completion of mode switch testing, it was determined that 3-SR-3.3.1.2.4, Source Range Monitor (SRM) System Count Rate and Signal to Noise Ratio Check, was not performed as required. The SR was subsequently completed at approximately 2235 hours CDT. SRMs A, B, and D were found to be operable. Following completion of the SRM system test, it was determined that the mode switch testing had been conducted in violation of an action statement for inoperable SRMs which required the mode switch to be in the shutdown position. Therefore, TVA is reporting this event in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73 (a)(2)(i)(B), as any operation or condition prohibited by the plants Technical Specifications. The root cause of this event was inadequate procedures, which resulted in misapplication of the requirements for operability of the SRMs.

2982016001|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   On April 25, 2016, while performing a walkdown of Control Room panels, it was noticed that the green indication light for High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) auxiliary lube oil pump (ALOP) was not illuminated. A non-licensed operator was dispatched to the HPCI ALOP starter and reported that the local indication lights were not illuminated. HPCI was declared inoperable at 2117 Central Daylight Time (CDT) resulting in entry into Technical Specifications (TS) ing Condition of Operation 3.5.1, Condition C, HPCI System Inoperable. Investigation determined that the coil in the electrical relay for the ALOP, which had recently been replaced during a preventive maintenance window, had failed after 133 hours of service. The cause of the failure was determined to be the prior pre-installation checks performed by NuTherm on the relay were inadequate to prevent the type of infant mortality failure that occurred in this case. HPCI was declared operable at 1314 CDT on April 26, 2016, after the coil was replaced. This event is being reported as a loss of safety function due to HPCI being a single-train safety system, as a condition prohibited by TS and in accordance with 10 CFR Part 21. The potential safety consequences of this event were minimal due to both the limited duration the condition existed and the redundant/diverse core cooling systems which remained operable. NRC  366 (04-2017) NRC  366A U.S. (04-2017) .
2982016001|3|DESCRIPTION|1|PLANT STATUS Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS) was in Mode 1, Power Operation, at 100 percent steady state power at the time the condition was identified. Service Water Pump "B" and Service Water Booster Pump "B" were inoperable when High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) was inoperable. No other emergency core cooling systems were inoperable during the event. BACKGROUND The HPCI System (El IS:BJ) provides protection to the core for the case of a small break in the reactor coolant pressure boundary which does not result in rapid depressurization of the reactor vessel (EIIS:RPV). The HPCI System permits the nuclear plant to be shutdown while maintaining sufficient reactor vessel water inventory until the reactor vessel is depressurized. The HPCI System continues to operate until reactor vessel pressure is below the pressure at which Low Pressure Coolant Injection (EIIS:BO) operation or Core Spray System (EllS:BM) operation can be used to maintain core cooling. HPCI consists of a steam turbine assembly (El IS:TRB) driving a multi-stage booster and main pump assembly (EIIS:P) and system piping, valves, controls and instrumentation. The HPCI turbine is driven by steam from the reactor which is generated by decay and residual heat. A control governor (EIIS:65) receives a HPCI flow signal and adjusts the turbine steam control valve (El IS:SCV) so that HPCI design pump discharge flow rate is obtained. The flow signal used for automatic control of the HPCI turbine is derived from a differential pressure measurement across a flow element (EIIS:FE) in the HPCI pump discharge pipeline. The governor controls the pressure applied to the hydraulic operator of the turbine control valve, which, in turn, controls the steam flow to the HPCI turbine. Upon receipt of the actuation signal, the auxiliary oil pump starts, providing hydraulic pressure for the turbine stop valve and turbine control valve hydraulic operator. The flow signal will ramp the control governor until rated flow is achieved. As hydraulic oil pressure is developed, the turbine stop valve and the turbine control valve open simultaneously and the turbine accelerates toward the speed setting of the control governor. As HPCI flow increases, the flow signal adjusts the control governor setting so that design flow is maintained. DESCRIPTION On April 25, 2016, while performing a walkdown of Control Room panels, a licensed operator noticed that the green indication light for the HPCI auxiliary lube oil pump (ALOP) was not illuminated. The bulb in the Control Room panel was replaced, but did not illuminate. A non-licensed station operator was subsequently sent to the HPCI ALOP starter to verify local indications and found the local indication lights were not illuminated on the starter rack, indicating that the ALOP starter had lost power. The ALOP is required to start in order to open the steam admission valves for the HPCI turbine. An attempt was made in the Control Room to start the ALOP, but it did not start.

ABSTRACT (   On April 25, 2016, while performing a walkdown of Control Room panels, it was noticed that the green indication light for High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) auxiliary lube oil pump (ALOP) was not illuminated. A non-licensed operator was dispatched to the HPCI ALOP starter and reported that the local indication lights were not illuminated. HPCI was declared inoperable at 2117 Central Daylight Time (CDT) resulting in entry into Technical Specifications (TS) ing Condition of Operation 3.5.1, Condition C, HPCI System Inoperable. Investigation determined that the coil in the electrical relay for the ALOP, which had recently been replaced during a preventive maintenance window, had failed after 133 hours of service. The cause of the failure was determined to be the prior pre-installation checks performed by NuTherm on the relay were inadequate to prevent the type of infant mortality failure that occurred in this case. HPCI was declared operable at 1314 CDT on April 26, 2016, after the coil was replaced. This event is being reported as a loss of safety function due to HPCI being a single-train safety system, as a condition prohibited by TS and in accordance with 10 CFR Part 21. The potential safety consequences of this event were minimal due to both the limited duration the condition existed and the redundant/diverse core cooling systems which remained operable.

2982016003|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   On September 14, 2016, during testing of the Reactor Recirculation Motor Generator Ventilation Air Operated Isolation Valves (AOV), HV-AOV-265 failed to close as required by Technical Specifications. Operations declared HV-AOV-265 inoperable and entered ing Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.6.4.2, Condition A, and commenced preparations to transition the plant to single loop operation, including reducing the plant to approximately 50 percent power. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the air supply line to the valve was pinched between the valve actuator and a scaffold that was erected to support work on a nearby component. After modifying the scaffold and replacing the pinched airline, the valve was tested satisfactorily and Operations exited the LCO and activities to prepare for transition to single loop operation were terminated. The root cause of the event is that personnel involved in the planning, construction, and inspection of the scaffold built for a nearby component were not aware of the unique external movement path of the valve actuator. To prevent recurrence, the procedure will be revised to include specific guidance for the planning, building and inspection of scaffolds in the vicinity of HV-AOV-265 and other AOVs having actuators of similar design.

2982016003|3|DESCRIPTION|1|PLANT STATUS Cooper Nuclear Station was in Mode 1, Power Operation, at 89 percent power, approaching the end of Cycle 29 in two-loop operation, at the time the condition was identified. BACKGROUND The safety objective of the Secondary Containment system [EIIS:NG] in conjunction with other... engineering safeguards and nuclear safety systems is to limit the release to the environs of radioactive material so that off-site doses from a postulated design basis accident will be below the values permitted. The reactor building isolation and control system serves to trip the reactor building [EIIS:NG] supply and exhaust fans [El IS:FAN], isolate the normal ventilation system and provide the starting signals for the Standby Gas Treatment (SGT) [El IS:BH] system in the event of a postulated Loss of Coolant Accident inside the drywell [EIIS:NG] or the postulated fuel handling accident in the reactor building. Two normally open dampers [EIIS:DMP], in series, are provided both in the supply path and two exhaust paths for the reactor building and the two supply and exhaust paths for Reactor Recirculation Motor Generator (RRMG) set ventilation. Each set of dampers consists of one air actuated damper, supplied by instrument air backed up by an accumulator [EIIS:ACC] with an assured one-hour supply capacity, and a motor operated damper. These dampers ensure redundant, diverse isolation capability for the reactor building in the event of a release of radioactive material to the reactor building. These dampers close automatically on a Group 6 (Secondary Containment Isolation) isolation signal. HV-AOV-265 is the RRMG Ventilation Supply Outboard Isolation Valve for RRMG 1B. This air operated valve (AOV) is normally open during plant operation. In addition to driving the actuator shaft, the air actuator cylinder physically rotates when the valve is opened or closed. This results in a large actuator movement path that includes the actuator shaft, cylinder, valve disc arm, and the airlines that connect to the cylinder. DESCRIPTION On September 14, 2016, during testing of the Reactor Recirculation Motor Generator Ventilation Air Operated Isolation Valves, the control switch for HV-AOV-265 was taken to close for valve stroke timing. The valve failed to close. HV-AOV-265 was declared inoperable and Technical Specification (TS) ing Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.6.4.2, Condition A, Required Action A.1, "Isolate the affected penetration flow path by use of at least one closed and de-activated valve within 8 hours," was entered. In addition, Operations commenced preparations for transitioning the plant to single loop operation, including reducing power to approximately 50 percent to support removing the associated RRMG set from service. Operations attempted to close HV-AOV-265 while an Engineer was stationed locally to observe the valve's operation. The Engineer identified that during the attempt to close the valve, the air supply line became pinched between the moving cylinder of the valve actuator and a scaffold that had been erected on June 29, 2016, to support work on a different valve.  2016   - 003 REV NO. - 00 NRC  366 (06-2016) Page 3 of 4 NRC  366  U.S. (11-2015)   (LER) (See Page 2 for required number of digits/characters for each block) (See NUREG-1022, R 3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1022/r3/) APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

Further investigation revealed that the airline had been crimped and required replacement. After modifying the scaffold to remove the interference with the operation of the valve, the airline for HV-AO-265 was replaced and the valve stroke testing was re-performed satisfactorily.

BASIS FOR  This condition is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by TS because the scaffolding, installed in June 2016, was in a position to block the movement of the valve since that time.

2982016004|1|TITLE|1|Closure of Multiple Main Steam Isolation Valves due to High Flow Signal
2982016004|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   On September 24, 2016, at 20:40 hours, during reactor cooldown for Refueling Outage 29, Cooper Nuclear Station control room operators closed the inboard Main Steam Isolation Valves (MSIV) to minimize steam flow to control the reactor cooldown rate. Reactor pressure was controlled using the Main Steam Line Drains; and the condensate/feed system was available for reactor water level control. On September 25, 2016, at 01:03 hours, while equalizing pressure across the MSIVs to below 200 psid, a differential pressure of 190 psid was established. Upon opening MS-AO-80A, a Group 1 isolation was immediately received due to a Main Steam Line high flow signal. The control room operators subsequently equalized pressure and successfully opened MS-AO-80A, as well as the remaining MSIVs, at 18:52 hours. The cause of the event was insufficient procedure guidance exists regarding limitations on opening the MSIVs. To correct this, the applicable procedure has been revised to change the differential pressure limitations for opening MSIVs from 200 psid to 80 psid. The safety significance of the event is low and did not pose a threat to the health and safety of the public. NRC  366 (06-2016) NRC  366 U.S. (11-2015)
2982016004|3|DESCRIPTION|1|PLANT STATUS Cooper Nuclear Station was in Mode 3, Hot Shutdown, at approximately 330 psig, at the time the condition was identified. BACKGROUND The Main Steam system conducts steam from the reactor vessel, via four steam lines, through the Primary Containment to the Main Steam Turbine. Each steam line has two, normally open, Main Steam Isolation Valves (MSIVs) [EIIS:ISV], one inside and one outside the Primary Containment. The MSIVs close automatically upon receipt of certain isolation signals to prevent damage to the fuel cladding by limiting the loss of reactor water during a steam line break outside Primary Containment and also to limit the release of radioactive materials in case of a major leak from Primary Containment. Main Steam Line (MSL) Flow-High is provided to detect a break of the MSL and to initiate closure of the MSIVs. If the steam were allowed to continue flowing out of the break, the reactor would depressurize and the core could uncover. If the Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) water level decreases too far, fuel damage could occur. Therefore, the isolation is initiated on high flow to prevent or minimize core damage. The MSL high flow trip setting was selected high enough to permit the isolation of one MSL for test at rated power without causing an automatic isolation of the rest of the steam lines yet low enough to permit early detection of a steam line break. The MSL flow signals are initiated from 16 differential pressure switches [EIIS:PDIS] that are connected to the four MSLs. The differential pressure switches are arranged such that, even though physically separated from each other, all four connected to one MSL would be able to detect the high flow. DESCRIPTION On September 24, 2016, at 20:40 hours, during reactor cooldown for Refueling Outage 29, Operations closed the inboard MSIVs to minimize steam flow to control the reactor cooldown rate in accordance with the Normal Shutdown procedure. Reactor pressure was controlled using the main steam line drains. The condensate/feed system was available for reactor water level control. On September 25, 2016, at 01:03 hours, when Operations utilized the Main Steam procedure to equalize pressure across the MSIVs to below 200 psid, a differential pressure (DP) of approximately 190 psid was established. When MS-AO-80A was opened, a Group 1 Isolation was immediately received. All open MSIVs, as well as the MSL Drain Isolation Valves MS-MO-74 and MS-MO-77, closed. The Group 1 isolation was caused by a MSL high flow signal on MSL 'A' as the valve was opening. This was a valid signal based on a review of the steam flow indication for MSL 'A'. Upon investigation it was discovered that the Differential Pressure Indicating Switches (DPIS) for the MSL 'A' high flow signal have a setpoint of 105.8 psid, with a calibration tolerance of +/- 3 psid. The DPIS' measure DP created by flow through the flow element upstream of the MSIV. Therefore, with static DP across the closed MSIVs, at approximately 190 psid prior to opening MS-AO-80A, it was possible that the DPIS' would exceed their setpoint as the MSIV opened and the DP was transferred to Page 2 of 4

2982016005|3|DESCRIPTION|1|PLANT STATUS Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS) was in Mode 5, Refueling, at 0 percent power, at the time of the events. BACKGROUND On January 15, 2016, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued Enforcement Guidance Memorandum (EGM) 11-003, Revision 3, "Dispositioning Boiling Water Reactor Licensee Noncompliance with Technical Specification Containment Requirements During Operations with a Potential for Draining the Reactor Vessel." EGM 11-003, Revision 3, provides generic enforcement discretion to allow implementation of specific interim actions as an alternative to full compliance with plant technical specifications related to Secondary Containment operability during Mode 5 Operations with a Potential for Draining the Reactor Vessel (OPDRV) activities. To ensure compliance with interim actions specified in the EGM, CNS added guidance to plant Procedure 0.50.5, "Outage Shutdown Safety." DESCRIPTION During Refueling Outage 29 (RE-29), CNS implemented the guidance of EGM 11-003, Revision 3, four times. Consistent with EGM 11-003, Revision 3, Secondary Containment operability was not maintained during OPDRV activities, and Required Action C.2 of Technical Specification (TS) 3.6.4.1 was not completed. The following provides the dates which EGM 11-003 was implemented: 1. On October 1 and 2, 2016, the EGM was utilized to allow work on Reactor Recirculation Pump A (RR-P-A) and RR-P-B without the jet pump plugs installed while performing Surveillance Procedure 6.1SGT.401, "SGT A Fan Capacity Test, SGT B Cooling Flow Test and Check Valve 1ST (Div 1)." 2. From October 2-5, 2016, the EGM was utilized to allow work on RR-P-A, RR-P-B, Control Rod Drive (CRD) withdrawal/bypass operations and Hydraulic Control Unit (HCU) 42-31 during repairs to Main Steam Air Operated Valve 86B. 3. On October 6, 2016, the EGM was utilized to work on RR-P-A and RR-P-B without the jet pump plugs installed while draining Reactor Core Isolation Cooling 12 Relief Valve and flushing Main Steam Isolation Valves (MSIV). 4.

2982016006|3|DESCRIPTION|1|PLANT STATUS Cooper Nuclear Station was in MODE 5, Refueling, at 0 percent power, at the time of the event. Diesel Generator (DG) 2 was inoperable for maintenance. BACKGROUND The Control Room Emergency Filter System (CREFS) [EIIS:JH] is designed to provide a radiologically controlled environment to ensure the habitability of the control room for the safety of control room operators under all plant conditions. The CREFS is a standby system. The instrumentation and controls for the CREFS automatically isolate the normal ventilation intake and initiate action to pressurize the main control room and filter incoming air to minimize the infiltration of radioactive material into the control room environment. The safety related function of CREFS includes a single high efficiency air filtration system for emergency treatment of outside supply air and a Control Room Envelope boundary that limits the inleakage of unfiltered air. The system consists of a prefilter, a high efficiency air particulate air filter [El IS:FLT], an activated charcoal adsorber [EllS:ADS] section, a supply fan [EllS:FAN], and emergency booster fan, an exhaust booster fan, and the associated ductwork [EIIS:DUCT], valves [EllS:V] or dampers [EIIS:DMP], doors [EllS:DR], barriers, and instrumentation. Technical Specifications (TS) 3.7.4 requires one supply fan to be Operable to support CREFS Operability. In MODES 4 and 5, maintaining CREFS operable is not required except during Operations with a Potential for Draining the Reactor Vessel (OPDRV); and during movement of lately irradiated fuel assemblies in the secondary containment. Due to radioactive decay, CREFS is only required to be OPERABLE during fuel handing involving handling of lately irradiated fuel. Power supply for Supply. Fan SF-C-1A is MCC LX (Division 1). Power supply for SF-C-1B is MCC-TX (Division 2). DESCRIPTION On October 21, 2016, Operations declared Diesel Generator 2 Inoperable in preparation for performing planned maintenance: Therefore, only SF-C-1A had essential power available. On October 23, 2016, at 11:54 hours, Operations entered an OPDRV condition for Control Rod Drive maintenance using a freeze seal. The OPDRV condition required CREFS to be operable. On October 23, 2016, at 13:56 hours, it was observed that control room supply fans were shaking while SF-C-1A was running, and it was noticed that a belt guard bracket had broken off.

U.S. NARRATIVE A vibration analysis was performed and results indicated that vibration readings were elevated across all points for the motor and fan. It was recommended that SF-C-1A be removed from service. Operations declared CREFS inoperable at 19:08 hours, entering TS ing Condition for Operation 3.7.4, Condition A. At 19:53 hours, SF-C-1B was started and SF-C-1A was secured. The fan was repaired on October 24 and 25, 2016. A vibration analysis was performed on October 26, 2016, with satisfactory results and Operations declared CREFS operable at 13:41 on October 27, 2016. During investigation it was found that the drive end bearing locking collar was loose from the bearing and the shaft. This allowed the shaft to turn within the bearing inner race, causing damage to the shaft and resulting in high vibration levels.

2982016007|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   On October 28, 2016, during replacement of relay PCIS-REL-K27 at Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS), the action of installing a new relay onto the shared plastic DIN rail disturbed the mounting rail in a manner that caused contacts of the adjacent relay, PCIS-REL-K30, to open. This caused Shutdown Cooling (SDC) isolation valve RHR-MO-17 to close, which actuated the logic to trip the running 'A' Residual Heat Removal (RHR) pump. Operations declared 'A' RHR SDC subsystem inoperable at 09:24 hours and entered ing Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.9.7, Condition A, and Condition C.

2982016007|3|DESCRIPTION|1|PLANT STATUS Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS) was in Mode 5, Refueling, at 0 percent power, at the time of the event. BACKGROUND The safety objective of the Residual Heat Removal (RHR) system [EllS:BO] is to provide core cooling, in conjunction with other Emergency Core Cooling Systems, and to provide containment cooling as required during abnormal operational transients and postulated accidents. The RHR system consists of two heat exchangers [EllS:HX], four main system pumps [EIIS:P], and associated piping, valves [EIIS:V], controls and instrumentation. Irradiated fuel in the shutdown reactor core generates heat during the decay of fission products and increases the temperature of the reactor coolant. The decay heat must be removed to reduce the temperature of the reactor coolant to less than or equal to 212 degreeS Fahrenheit (F) in preparation for performing Refueling or Cold Shutdown maintenance operations, or the decay heat must be removed for maintaining the reactor in Hot Shutdown condition. Shutdown Cooling (SDC) is a subsystem of RHR and is placed in operation during a normal reactor shutdown and cooldown. Reactor Coolant is pumped by the RHR main system pumps from recirculation loop 'A' through the RHR heat exchangers prior to returning to the reactor vessel through connections to their respective recirculation loop. The relays used in the Primary Containment Isolation System (PCIS) logic are model CR120A industrial relays [EllS:RLY] manufactured by General Electric. The CR120A relay has a max voltage rating of 300 volts and is a small multi-circuit AC control relay. The relays are popular due to their small size and long mechanical life. CNS currently performs predictive maintenance plans on the relays to replace the coils on a 10-year frequency. DESCRIPTION On October 28, 2016, SDC isolation valves RHR-MO-17 and RHR-MO-18 were open with RHR Loop A in RHR SDC flush lineup, with an intention of placing RHR Loop A in SDC. The Alternate Decay Heat Removal (ADHR) system was maintaining Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) and Spent Fuel Pool temperature. Work orders were created to replace twenty-seven PCIS relay coils, including relay coil for PCIS-REL-K27, in Refueling Outage (RE29). During testing after completion of the work order, it was identified that the PCIS-REL-K27 relay did not actuate as expected (delayed response). This led to a revision of the work order to replace the entire relay instead of just a coil replacement. This required more wires to be lifted and the relay to be removed from the DIN rail and replaced. SDC was placed in service at 08:49 hours on October 28, 2016. Subsequently, during replacement of the PCIS-REL-K27 relay, the action of installing a new relay onto the shared plastic DIN rail disturbed the mounting rail in a manner that caused the 1-2 contact of the adjacent relay, PCIS-REL-K30, to open. This caused RHR-MO-17 to close, which actuated the logic to trip the running 'A' RHR pump. Operations declared A RHR SDC subsystems inoperable at 09:24 hours and entered Technical Specification (TS) 1. FACILITY NAME Cooper Nuclear Station 2.   05000- 298  2016 3.   -007 REV NO. -00

2982016008|3|DESCRIPTION|1|PLANT STATUS Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS) was in Mode 1, Power Operation, at approximately 10 percent power, at the time of the event. BACKGROUND The Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) [EllS:BN] system provides makeup water to the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) [EIIS:RPV] following an RPV isolation in order to prevent the release of radioactive materials to the environs as a result of inadequate core cooling. The RCIC system consists of a steam driven turbine-pump unit [EIIS:TRB, P], piping, and valves [EllS:V] to provide steam to the turbine, as well as piping and valves to transfer water from the suction sources to the core via the Feed water [El IS:SJ] system line, where the coolant is distributed within the RPV. The RCIC system pump supply is normally aligned to the Emergency Condensate Storage Tanks. The pump discharge is normally isolated and valve operation is required to align in either RPV injection mode or test return mode. Upon receipt of an initiation signal, the RCIC turbine accelerates to provide a specified pump flow. As the RCIC flow increases, the turbine control valve (El IS:FCV] is automatically adjusted to maintain the required design flow. RCIC is required to be operable during Modes 1, 2 and 3 with reactor steam dome pressure > 150 psig, since RCIC is the primary non-emergency core cooling system water source for core cooling when the RPV is isolated and pressurized. RCIC-AOV-PCV23 is a 1" pressure controlled globe valve located on the RCIC pump discharge line to the RCIC lube oil cooler. This valve has an air operated actuator which regulates the pressure of the cooling water based on the output of its controller, RCIC-PC-23. The valve works as a pressure reducing orifice to maintain the pressure in the lube oil cooling line below 60 psig to prevent over pressurizing the cooling circuit. Upon a loss of air to the valve operator a spring within the actuator will force the valve open. The actuator includes a travel stop, which is designed to prevent over-pressurization of the cooling circuit by limiting the distance the valve can open. DESCRIPTION On November 8, 2016, at 11:27 hours, CNS Operators declared RCIC inoperable for surveillance testing and entered Technical Specification (TS) ing Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.5.3, Condition A. Subsequently at 11:41 hours, Operations declared RCIC inoperable due to a water leak from the lube oiler cooler lower flange. During investigation it was determined that valve RCIC-AOV-PCV23, which was replaced during Refueling Outage 29, was full open causing excessive cooling water pressure to the lube oil cooler. Initial examination revealed that the actuator was supplied with a.closed travel stop instead of the required open travel stop. This travel stop prevents over-pressurization of the cooling circuit by limiting the opening stroke distance of RCIC-AOV-PCV23. The purchase order for the replacement valve and actuator did not contain a part description stating a travel stop was required.  2016   - 008 REV NO. -00 NRC  366 (06-2016) 1. FACILITY NAME 2.   3.

2982016009|3|DESCRIPTION|1|PLANT STATUS Cooper Nuclear Station was in Mode 1, Power Operations, at 100 percent power, at the time of the event. BACKGROUND The Control Room Emergency Filter System (CREFS) [EIIS:JH] is designed to provide a radiologically controlled environment to ensure the habitability of the control room for the safety of control room operators under all plant conditions. The CREFS is a standby system. The instrumentation and controls for the CREFS automatically isolate the normal ventilation intake and initiate action to pressurize the main control room and filter incoming air to minimize the infiltration of radioactive material into the control room environment. The safety related function of CREFS includes a single high efficiency air filtration system for emergency treatment of outside supply air and a Control Room Envelope boundary that limits the inleakage of unfiltered air. The system consists of a prefilter, a high efficiency particulate air filter [EIIS:FLT], an activated charcoal adsorber [EIIS:ADS] section, a supply fan [EIIS:FAN], an emergency booster fan, an exhaust booster fan, and the associated ductwork [EllS:DUCT], valves [EllS:V] or dampers [EIIS:DMP], doors [EllS:DR], barriers, and instrumentation. Technical Specifications (TS) 3.7.4 requires one supply fan to be Operable to support CREFS Operability. DESCRIPTION On December 7, 2016, at 22:20 hours, a Control Room Operator (Operator) was performing the Division 1 Essential Control Building Ventilation functional test (surveillance procedure). The first step in the procedure directs the Operator to remove the non-essential control building Heating Ventilating Air Conditioning (HVAC) system from service per the operating procedure for the HVAC Control Building. This requires the Operator to place the standby control building supply fan to OFF (SF-C-1A-A or SF-C-1A-B), then place the running control building supply fan to OFF (SF-C-1A-A or SF-C-1A-B). The Operator completed these steps correctly. The next steps are to place the control building recirculation fans RF-C-1A and RF-C-1B to OFF, respectively. The Operator instead turned off the CREFS supply fan SF-C-1A rather than the control building recirculation fan RF-C-1A. Not aware of the error, the Operator proceeded to the next step to turn off RF-C-1B. The Operator determined this step was complete when he noted the CREFS supply fan SF-C-1B was already OFF; although this step directs that RF-C-1B, control building recirculation fan be placed to OFF.

2982016010|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   From July 11, 2016, to July 15, 2016, the Torus area and Reactor Building floor drain valve control switches were placed in the OPEN position, per alarm card FP-1/C-4, due to fire detector FP-TD-19-2 being impaired. Subsequently, it was determined that by placing the floor drain valve control switches to OPEN, the automatic flood protection function that is credited in Cooper Nuclear Station's internal flooding analysis, was defeated. During the time the detector was impaired, there were no credited compensatory actions taken to ensure Division 1 Core Spray (CS) and Division 1 Residual Heat Removal (RHR) systems were protected from postulated flooding caused by a high-energy line break. As such, it was determined that both Division 1 CS and Division 1 RHR were inoperable for a period greater than allowed by Technical Specifications. The cause was determined to be that when the flooding requirements in the Reactor Building changed, a review of alarm cards did not identify alarm card FP-1/C-4 as needing updated.

2982016010|3|DESCRIPTION|1|PLANT STATUS Cooper Nuclear Station was in Mode 1, Power Operations, at 100 percent power, at the time of the event. BACKGROUND The Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) is designed, in conjunction with the primary and secondary containment, to limit the release of radioactive materials to the environment following a loss of coolant accident (LOCA). The ECCS uses two independent methods (flooding and spraying) to -cool the core during a LOCA. The ECCS network consists of the High Pressure Cooling Injection (HPCI) System [El IS:BJ], the Core Spray (CS) System [EllS:BM], the Low Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI),Mode of the Residual Heat Removal (RHR) System [EllS:B0], and the Automatic Depressurization System (ADS). The suppression pool provides the required source of water for the ECCS. The emergency condensate storage tanks (ECSTs) are capable of providing a source of water for the HPCI system. ECCS components located in the four Reactor Building [EIIS:NG] quads are subject to flooding from line breaks such as the steam tunnel feed water line break. The Technical Specifications (TS) related equipment contained in these quads are: Division 1 CS and Reactor Core Isolation Cooling [EllS:BN] in the Northeast quad; Division 1 RHR in the Northwest quad; Division 2 CS in the Southeast quad, and Division 2 RHR and HPCI in the Southwest quad. Division 2 CS is assumed and evaluated as lost during the 18-inch feed water flooding event. The Reactor Building floor drain and Torus drain valves [EIIS:V] are designed to close on respective sump hi-hi level conditions to divert water to the Torus area. The Reactor Building floor drain and the Torus drain valve closure are barriers credited in the internal flooding analysis. FP-TD-19-2 causes the following valves to fail closed: RW-A0V-A0767, RW-A0V-A0770, RW-AOV-AO768, RW-AOV-AO771, RW-A0V-A0773, RW-A0V-A0772, Torus Drain to Sump A Reactor Building Drains to Sump A Torus Drain to Sump B Reactor Building Drains to Sump B Reactor Building Drains to Sump C Reactor Building Drains to Sump D DESCRIPTION On July 11, 2016, at 1430 hours, while performing fire detection systems examination per surveillance procedure, it was identified that detector FP-TD-19-2 would not reset, thus initiating alarm FP-1/C-4, Reactor Building Southeast Quad Zone 19.

Power had been reduced at the beginning of dayshift to support a 500 KV transmission line outage. The reactor trip was due to a Main Turbine trip caused by a Main Generator Protection signal initiated by a main generator automatic voltage regulator (AVR) volts/hertz over excitation protection relay. All emergency core cooling systems and emergency safeguards feature systems functioned as expected. As found calibration data for the generator protection logic relay were found out of specification low. An evaluation determined the cause of the event to be that the organization failed to develop and implement 
3112016002|3|DESCRIPTION|1|On 2/4/16 at 11:21 Salem Unit 2 automatically tripped from approximately 74% power on Generator Protection, initiated by the main generator Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) STVlvolts/hertz relay {TB/RLY}. At 11:20:36 Overhead Annunciator (OHA) H21 — "Generator Voltage/Frequency High" was received, followed by OHA H27 — "Gen Vreg Trbl" at 11:21:19. At 11:21:25 OHA F47 — "Generator Protection" was received, coincident with the Unit 2 trip. The STV1 relay is an over excitation protection relay. Troubleshooting identified the STV1 as a contributor to the trip, so the calibration of the relay was checked. The as-found calibration data showed that the relay pick up setting was out of specification low. In the time period just prior to the Unit 2 trip, the generator was operating at approximately 26.1 KV, which corresponds to a 2.175 V/Hz sensed at the STV1 relay. The as found pick up for the STV1 relay was at 2.17 V/Hz, so the plant was operating above the relay's pick up set point. Once the set point was exceeded, the 1-121 OHA alarm was received in the Control Room. After the time delay of 45 seconds had elapsed, the trip relay picked up, starting the sequence of tripping the AVR on an external trip and dropping the generator field, causing the turbine trip on generator protection. The turbine trip resulted in a reactor scram. The Unit 2 AVR was rep'aced during the 2R21 refueling outage in Fall 2015. The STV1 was original plant design. A new relay was purchased, calibrated, and installed at the time of the AVR replacement. A four-hour NRC Event Notification (EN) was required by 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) for actuation of the reactor protection system (RPS) when the reactor is critical and an eight-hour NRC EN was required by 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) for a valid actuation of the auxiliary feed water system. EN 51708 was completed at 13:33 on 02/04/2016. Thisis being submitted pursuant to the requirements of 10CFR50.73 (a)(2)(iv)(A), "Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B)."
3112016002|4|CAUSE|1|The generator trip, and subsequent automatic reactor trip, was initiated by the main generator automatic voltage regulator (AVR) STV1 volts/hertz over excitation protection relay. This relay tripped at a volts/hertz level less than the design set point (104.5% vs. 110%) during voltage manipulations to support a line outage. Failure analysis identified the cause of the trip as damage to the R14 rheostat on the STV1 relay card. This damage is attributable to either poor manufacturing quality or inadequate shipping and handling. This rheostat directly controls the set point at which the STV relay will trip for over excitation protection. This defect caused the relay to trip prior to its design value. The STV-1 relay could not be adjusted to within the manufacturer's acceptance criteria (+/-1%) with the failed R14 rheostat. The organization failed to develop and implement

IDENTIFICATION OCCURRENCE Event Date: 02/16/2016 Discovery Date: 02/16/2016 CONDITIONS PRIOROCCURRENCE Salem Unit 2 was in Mode 2 (Startup) at 4 percent rated thermal power (RTP). DESCRIPTION OCCURRRENCE On 2/16/16 at 0827 22 Steam Generator Feed Pump (SGFP) tripped while operators were transferring the steam supply to the pump from heating steam to main steam. Trip of 22 SGFP initiated emergency safeguard feature (ESF) actuation for start of the 21 and 22 Auxiliary Feed water (AFW) Pumps. This event occurred during Unit 2 start-up following a unit trip from generator protection. The digital feed water control system (DFCS) {SJ/DCC} indicated a trip on overspeed. Review of the Plant Computer and the Control Console did not indicate an overspeed trip. SGFP speed lowered during the swap from heating steam to main steam. SGFP condensate flow momentarily decreased, causing an increase in steam demand to 22 SGFP. At 08:27:17 22 SGFP speed rapidly increased from 2170 to 2450 RPM. The sudden increase in SGFP speed appears to be coincident with opening of the poppet valve, allowing a sudden increase in steam supply to 22 SGFP. Data downloaded from the digital feed water control system showed a 400 RPM speed increase occurred in 300 milliseconds with all three speed pick up relays indicating a overspeed rate change trip (SGFP acceleration rate trip). 22 SGFP speed slows from 2450 to < 300 RPM due to a SGFP trip as indicated from the digital feed water control system. No other spikes in SGFP speed were observed in the digital feed water control system, the Plant Computer or on the associated Control Console during this event.
3112016004|4|CAUSE|1|The 22 SGFP trip was a rate trip (-400 RPM increase in 300milliseconds) caused when the main steam poppet valve opened. A root cause evaluation was conducted for this event. The evaluation determined that one root cause was that the specification agreed upon by PSEG and the DFCS vendor did not identify the acceleration rate trip that was incorporated into the digital feed modification. An independent Critical Digital Review (CDR) was performed by an experienced independent vendor. The CDR did not identify the installation of the trip. The vendor was involved in the process throughout the entire lifecycle, from requirements definition to factory acceptance testing. The design requirements/specifications as defined by PSEG for the implementation of the modification did not identify the acceleration rate trip. The DFCS vendor was contacted and requested to validate that the acceleration rate trip was not discussed in the Functional requirements document. The response to the inquiry was 'The Trip on acceleration is NOT required; therefore it is not contained in the Functional Requirements Document" The trip function was installed without knowledge by engineering and the vendor had documentation identifying function/trip did exist, but did not specifically communicate the existence or functionality of the specific trip function. The acceleration rate trip will be removed from the system in accordance with the design change process. A second root cause identified was that the instructions for swapping from low pressure steam to high pressure steam provided in the procedure utilized did not include a conservative description/method for implementing a change in steam supply source to minimize speed perturbation. A review of data collected from the event was performed. The speed and demand signals specific to this event indicated a delta from previous start ups and a speed perturbation was experienced. The feed pump operation was performed within the requirements of the procedure and the review performed by this evaluation indicates that this was not the conservative method to operate/perform the transition from heating steam (HS) to main steam (MS). Additional guidance is required to prevent further speed perturbations.

3132016004|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   On September 29, 2016, at Arkansas Nuclear One, Unit 1 (ANO-1), during refueling outage 1R26 with both trains of Decay Heat Removal (DHR) in service, a 0.125 gpm leak was identified in the DHR system at a one-inch drain line. This leak was on a section of cross-connect piping shared by both trains of the DHR system. The consequence of the leak was that both trains of the DHR system were declared inoperable. The leakage was due to a fatigue crack caused by vibration of the drain line due to a pipe support that was not designed for system vibration. Other systems and components in ANO-1 and ANO, Unit 2 (ANO-2) exposed to elevated system vibration were evaluated with respect to this condition. As a result of this evaluation, socket welds on other drains and vents in the ANO-1 DHR system were cut out and replaced, and pipe supports were modified where needed to withstand system vibration.

3132016004|3|DESCRIPTION|1|A. Plant Status At the time this condition was identified, ANO-1 was shut down and in a refueling outage with the core fully loaded. No structures, systems, or components were out of service at the time of this event that contributed to this event. B. Event Description At approximately 20:47 on September 29, 2016, the ANO-1 Control Room received a report of a leak in the ANO-1 Reactor Building (RB). Investigation revealed a 0.125 gpm leak in a class 1 pipe from a socket weld [VTV] where the drain pipe connects to the main DHR system injection line. This leak was on a section of cross-connect piping shared by both trains of the DHR system. Operations closed RB penetrations providing direct access from the RB atmosphere to the outside atmosphere in accordance with required actions of DHR Technical Specification (TS) 3.9.5. To reduce the potential for propagation of the weld crack, Operations maintained DHR flow at less than 2000 gpm and monitored data from vibration probes affixed to the affected piping to maintain low vibration levels. To remove the reliance on the DHR system, actions were taken to defuel the reactor vessel, which was accomplished at 12:00 on Thursday, October 6, 2016. The leak remained less than or equal to 0.125 gpm from the time of discovery until the piping was removed from service for repair. C. Background — System Design The DHR /Low Pressure Injection (LPI) [BP] pumps have three major functions. The first is to remove decay heat from the fuel and Reactor Coolant System (RCS) once the plant is shut down and cooled down. To do this, the DHR pump takes suction from the RCS, discharges through a cooler which is cooled by Service Water, and injects the cooled water back into the RCS. A second function is to provide required net positive suction head from the RB Sump to the High Pressure Injection (HP1) pumps in the event of an intermediate size loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA). The third function is LPI of borated water from the Borated Water Storage Tank or RB Sump into the RCS in the event of a large-break LOCA or after cooling down and depressurizing sufficiently following an intermediate break LOCA. D. Event Cause This condition was self-revealing. The direct cause of the leak was a fatigue crack caused by vibration of the drain. ANO's

3212016001|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   On 02/11/16, Unit 1 fuel movement activities were restarted after repairs to the main grapple camera. A refueling interlock of the main grapple was encountered while moving a double blade guide, caused by the disconnection of 20 Rod Position Information System (RPIS) Position Indicating Probes (PIPs). The operating crew began troubleshooting and determined that bypassing the RPIS probe "full-in" would clear the interlock. However the crew used a section of the site specific procedure for control rod withdrawal during refuel that wasn't applicable at the time. The RPIS indications were bypassed and the movement of the double blade guide was recommenced at 12:00 followed by fuel movement. After a review of Technical Specifications 3.9.4, it was determined that fuel movement should not be performed with the RPIS probe disconnected and bypassed because the associated control rods were not disarmed with a tagout. Fuel movement activities were then halted. NRC  366 (02-2014) 1. FACILITY NAME 3. 2.  6. NRC  366A  U.S. (02-2014)
3212016001|3|DESCRIPTION|1|On 02/11/16, during the Hatch 1R27 outage, fuel movement activities were halted, due to a faulty grapple camera. Once the camera was fixed, the fuel movement activities recommenced. After a couple of minutes, the operator was unable to lower a blade guide into the core. It was discovered that a refueling interlock of the main grapple was encountered. This had occurred because 20 Rod Position Indication System (RPIS) Position Indicating Probes (PIPs) had been disconnected. The work to remove the PIPs was authorized by the Work Release Supervisor and the Unit 1 Shift Supervisor, out of sequence. The RPIS indications were bypassed and the blade guide was lowered into the core followed by continuing fuel movement. After a review of Technical Specification 3.9.4, Control Rod Position Indication, it was determined that fuel movement should not be performed with the RPIS probe disconnected and bypassed because the associated control rods were not hydraulically disarmed by closing the drive water and exhaust water isolation valves in accordance with the Technical Specification Bases. Fuel movement was then halted. The Unit 1 Shift Supervisor instructed the PIPs to be reinstalled. The PIPs were installed, RPIS full-in bypass box switches for all rods (20) were un-bypassed and the fuel movement activities were resumed.The cause of moving fuel while the RPIS "full-in" indication was inoperable was due to inadequate procedure usage. The operations Shift Manager also became involved in troubleshooting and did not maintain an oversight role. This contributed to a misinterpretation of technical specifications, leading to the inappropriate decision to bypass the (20) RPIS full-in indications prior to commencing fuel movement. ABILITY ANALYSIS SAFETY ASSESSMENT This event is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation or condition prohibited by Technical Specifications (TS) 3.9.4 which prohibits performing fuel movement when one or more required control rod position indication channels are inoperable. Refueling equipment interlocks restrict the operation of the refueling equipment or the withdrawal of control rods to reinforce unit procedures that prevent the reactor from potentially achieving criticality during refueling. The refueling interlock circuitry senses the conditions of the refueling equipment and the control rods. Depending on the sensed conditions, interlocks are actuated to prevent the operation of the refueling equipment or the withdrawal of control rods. NRC  366A .:1-2001: NRC  366A (02-2014) 1.

The Control Rod Drive Pumps had been stopped, thus preventing any potential control rod movement by removing the motive force. The control rods were therefore effectively hydraulically disarmed but not as suggested by the Tech Spec Bases 3.9.4 by closing the drive water and exhaust water isolation valves. Even though this condition was contrary to Tech Spec requirements, no change in reactivity resulted and no movement of the control rods occurred. Based on this information this reported condition had very low safety significance.

3212016002|3|DESCRIPTION|1|In February 2016, with Unit 1 at 0 percent rated thermal power due to a scheduled refueling outage, operations with the potential to drain the reactor vessel (OPDRV) activities were performed while in Mode 5 (Refueling Mode) contrary to Technical Specification (TS) 3.6.4.1. The NRC recognizes that such activities need to be performed during refueling outages. Activities are underway to formulate acceptable generic changes to BWR Technical Specifications. NRC Regulatory Issue Summary (RIS) 2012-11 communicated this guidance to the industry. Enforcement Guidance Memorandum (EGM) 11-003, Revision 3 currently provides enforcement discretion for licensee noncompliance with TS containment requirements during OPDRV activities until December 31, 2017 while the NRC staff and Boiling Water Reactor Owner's Group finalize a generic solution for TS changes. The required interim actions specified in the EGM were incorporated into plant procedure 31GO-OPS-025-0 "Operations With The Potential To Drain The Reactor Vessel". This procedure was utilized during the following three occasions during the 2016 Unit 1 Refueling Outage: Table 1: Hatch Unit 1 OPDRVs Performed February 2016 OPDRV Activity Start End LPRM replacement activity 02/13/2016, 2130 EST 02/15/2016, 0149 EST CRD push-pull activity 02/15/2016, 1213 EST 02/16/2016, 0740 EST CRD insert / re-couple activity 02/17/2016, 1547 EST 02/18/2016, 1038 ESTImplementation of the required EGM 11-003, Revision 3 interim actions during the 2016 Unit 1 Refueling Outage was a planned activity. As such, no cause determination was performed for the events.  ABILITY SAFETY ASSESSMENT This event is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation or condition prohibited by Technical Specifications (TS) 3.6.4.1.C.3, which prohibits performing activities identified as OPDRVs in Mode 5 while secondary containment is inoperable. The OPDRVs discussed in this report performed during the Unit 2 Refueling Outage were accomplished using interim actions provided by the NRC in EGM 11-003, Revision 3. Hatch adhered to the NRC plain language meaning of OPDRV activities that could potentially result in draining or siphoning the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) water level below the top of the fuel. Hatch also met the requirements which specify the minimum makeup flow rate and water inventory based on OPDRV activities with long drain down times. 1. FACILITY NAME 3. 2.  6. Edwin I.

All other Mode 5 Technical Specifications requirements for OPDRV activities were followed. Since these compensatory measures were properly implemented, an adequate level of safety was provided during the performance of the OPDVR activities described in this report Based on this information, the performance of these OPDRV activities were determined to have a very low safety significance.

On February 16, 2016 at 0631 EST, during surface preparation work, axial indications were found on the WOL.

3212016003|3|DESCRIPTION|1|On February 16, 2016 at 0631 EST, with Unit 1 at 0 percent rated thermal power due to a scheduled refueling outage, it was discovered that an axial flaw found on the recirculation inlet nozzle 1B31-1RC-12BR-E-5 (1631-E5) to safe-end weldment had propagated into the Inconel Alloy 82 Weld Overlay (WOL) material installed in 1988. Evaluation of the as-found condition of the flaw did not meet ASME Section XI acceptance criteria. As part of normal pre-outage scope activities, plans were put in place to upgrade the 11331-E5 partial WOL to a FSWOL in order to allow for code qualified examinations. During surface preparation work, axial indications were found on the partial WOL. It was then discovered that the original flaw had propagated into the Inconel Alloy 82 WOL material installed in 1988. The flaw was repaired in accordance with an approved code alternative and 1631-E5 was upgraded to a full structural weld overlay (FSWOL) using intergranular stress corrosion cracking resistant Alloy 52 weld material.The unacceptable as-found condition of the defect found in the WOL for 1631-E5 was due to intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IGSCC). The 304 stainless steel piping and Inconel Alloy 182 weld materials are susceptible to this failure mode in a BWR environment. The station also lost track of the different design attributes of 1631-E5 weld repair. This led to mis-characterization of the weld as a FSWOL and extending the exam frequency, thus causing the station to not adequately monitor the growth of the flaw. Reliefs that reduced the frequency of performance of ISI code exams were approved by the NRC. Approval was based upon the ASME Class 1 WOL's meeting the requirements of being a full structural WOL type. Additionally, during the implementation of BWRVIP-075, a risk classification was required to prioritize the welds to be examined. However, the assumption that all Unit 1 WOL repairs were full structural welds affected the priority placed upon this weld. The flaw was repaired in accordance with an approved code alternative and 1B31-E5 was upgraded to a full structural weld overlay (FSWOL) using intergranular stress corrosion cracking resistant Alloy 52 weld material.

Upon performance of the subsequent liquid penetrant testing (PT) examination, it was discovered that the as-found condition of the flaw did not meet ASME Section XI acceptance criteria. Evaluation of the flaw found in the weld overlay suggests that the non-satisfactory PT examination is a result of the propagation of the original flaw that was found on the 1 E Recirculation Loop Piping. Though the weld flaw exceeded the acceptance criteria of ASME Section XI, no leakage from this flaw was identified at any time during operation or shutdown. There is reasonable assurance that there was not a breach in the credited RCS boundary due to the axial flaw not having grown through the weld overlay. Additionally, engineering evaluation of the structural integrity of the weld shows that the flawed component had adequate margin for all design basis events. The evaluation has shown that the axial flaw identified in Weld 1B31-1RC-12BR-E-5 located on the recirculation inlet system, meets the ASME Code, Section XI structural margin, considering a Service Level D structural factor in the evaluation, as required by the NRC Inspection Manual. Even though the flaw has a depth of 100% of original wall thickness, which exceeds the ASME Code, Section XI allowable flaw depth of 75% of wall thickness, the safety of the reactor pressure boundary was not compromised. It is, therefore, concluded that the flawed component had adequate margin for all Design Basis Loading Events when the flaw was identified and this condition had a very low safety significance.

DESCRIPTION On March 30 2016, with Unit 1 at 100 percent rated thermal power (RTP), "as-found" testing of the 3-stage main steam safety relief valves (SRVs) (EIIS Code RV) showed that two of the eleven main steam SRVs that were tested had experienced a drift in pressure lift setpoint during the previous operating cycle such that the allowable technical specification (TS) surveillance requirement (SR) 3.4.3.1 limit of 1150 +/- 34.5 (+1- 3%) psig had been exceeded. Below is a table illustrating the Unit 1 SRVs that failed as found testing results after being removed from service during the Spring 2016 refueling outage. MPL  Lift Pressure Percent Drift 1621-F013D 1B21-F013E 1113 psig 1106 psig -3.2% -3.8%The SRV pilots were disassembled and inspected while investigating the reason for the drift. SNC has determined that the linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) used to measure displacement confirmed the abutment gap closed pre-maturely. The pre-mature abutment gap closure is most likely due to loose manufacturing tolerances leading to SRV setpoint drift. ABILITY ANALYSIS SAFETY ASSESSMENT This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) because a condition occurred that is prohibited by TS 3.4.3. Specifically, an example of multiple test failures is given in NUREG-1022, Revision 3, "Event Reporting Guidelines 10 CFR 50.72 and 50.73" which describes the sequential testing of safety valves. This example notes that "Sometimes multiple valves are found to lift with set points outside of technical specification limits." NUREG-1022 further states in the example that "discrepancies found in TS surveillance tests should be assumed to occur at the time of the test unless there is firm evidence, based on a review of relevant information (e.g., the equipment history and the cause of failure), to indicate that the discrepancy occurred earlier. However, the existence of similar discrepancies in multiple valves is an indication that the discrepancies may well have arisen over a period of time and the failure mode should be evaluated to make this determination." Based on this guidance, the determination was made that this "as found" condition is reportable under the reporting requirements of 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B).

3252016001|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   On February 7, 2016, at 1312 Eastern Standard Time (EST), Unit 1 was in Mode 1 (i.e., Run) at 88 percent of rated power in end-of-cycle coastdown. At that time, an electrical fault occurred on a balance of plant 4160-volt bus, resulting in a lockout of the Startup Auxiliary Transformer (SAT) and a loss of both Reactor Recirculation pumps. Licensed personnel inserted a manual scram per procedure. Emergency Diesel Generators supplied emergency electrical busses until offsite power was restored at 1628 EST. The loss of power and reactor water level changes resulted in automatic closures of various Primary Containment Isolation Valves (PCIVs). The electrical fault resulted in an electrical explosion; therefore, an Alert was declared at 1326 EDT. The immediate cause of this event was a fault in a non-segregated electrical bus connected to the SAT. The root causes were insufficient detail in applicable maintenance instructions for inspecting the non-segregated bus housing and inadequate instructions for terminating electrical cables in a circuit breaker cubicle. 
3252016001|3|DESCRIPTION|1|On February 7, 2016, at 1312 EST, BSEP Unit 1 was in Mode 1 during end-of-cycle coastdown. Two arc flashes occurred in a 4160-volt electrical system which resulted in two phases of the system faulting to ground, which also constituted a phase-to-phase fault. The high differential current actuated the lockout on the Unit 1 Startup Auxiliary Transformer (SAT) [EA], which started all four emergency diesel generators. The loss of power to equipment fed from the SAT resulted in shutdown of both Reactor Recirculation system pumps. With both pumps not operating, station procedures require licensed personnel to insert a manual scram. This was performed immediately, and all control rods [AA] fully inserted into the core per design. The manual scram automatically shut down the main turbine [TA] and main generator [EL] per design. With the main generator offline, the power circuit breakers for the Unit Auxiliary Transformer (UAT) [EA]

3252016002|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   On March 4, 2016, at 1235 Eastern Standard Time (EST), Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) 3 was declared inoperable. At this time, EDG 1, Emergency bus El, and balance of plant (BOP) bus 1D were inoperable due to planned maintenance. Two inoperable EDGs represents a loss of safety function, for the onsite standby power source. Therefore, this condition is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D), as an event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of a system that is needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. In addition, it was determined that EDG 3 was inoperable for greater than Technical Specifications (TSs) Completion Times. Therefore, this condition is also being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as operation prohibited by the TSs. Additionally, on March 3, work was ongoing to restore power to BOP bus 1D when an error in the restoration sequence resulted in an invalid auto-start of EDGs 2 and 4. Because the invalid auto-starts of EDGs 2 and 4 are directly related to the events associated with this LER, it is being reported, herein, per 10 CFR • 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) rather than the optional 60-day telephone notification.

3252016002|3|DESCRIPTION|1|On March 2, at 1458 EST, EDG 1 was declared inoperable in support of modifications, maintenance activities, and testing. Emergency bus El and balance of plant (BOP) bus 1D were deenergized in support of this work. This was a planned maintenance activity, being performed during the ongoing Unit 1 refueling outage. Due to the shared electrical distribution system at Brunswick, Unit 2 was in TS 3.8.1, Condition B (i.e., two Unit 1 offsite circuits inoperable due to one Unit 1 balance of plant circuit path to the downstrethm 4.16 kV emergency bus inoperable for planned maintenance and the EDG associated with the affected downstream 4.16 kV emergency bus inoperable for planned maintenance). On March 3, work was ongoing to restore power to BOP bus 1D when an error in the restoration sequence resulted in an invalid auto-start of EDGs 2 and 4. The invalid signal mimicked under voltage on the startup auxiliary transformer (SAT) [EA], which is not a TS required start and, per design, would have started EDGs 1, 2, 3, and 4. EDG .1 was under clearance and, as such, did not start. However, it was also expected that EDG 3 should have started. Troubleshooting activities and a thorough EDG 1 modification review were initiated. As a result, on March 4, 2016, at 1235 hours EST, it was determined that continuity was lost across a dummy fuse block in the auto-start circuitry for EDG 3. This failure prevented TS required auto-actuation of EDG 3. Therefore, EDG 3 was declared inoperable. At this time, Unit 2

3252016004|1|TITLE|1|Tornado Missile Vulnerability Results in Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications
3252016004|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   On July 21, 2016, Units 1 and 2 were in Mode 1 (i.e., Run mode) at 100 percent of rated thermal power. At that time, Engineering personnel determined that a conduit in the Emergency Diesel Generator building was vulnerable to a tornado missile. The conduit contains cables associated with Unit 2 Nuclear Service Water (NSW) pump "B". If the cables were disabled by a tornado missile, NSW pump 2B would be inoperable. The plants' Technical Specifications (TS) require three of the site's four NSW pumps to be operable. Thus, any of the other NSW pumps removed from service for longer than the TS-allowed out of service time would be a condition prohibited by the TS. It has been found that this condition occurred. Enforcement Guidance Memorandum (EGM) 15-002 was implemented, and NSW pump 2B was considered operable but nonconforming. The tornado missile vulnerability has existed since original plant construction. Immediate compensatory measures included verifying that station procedures address tornadoes, high winds, and potential loss of vulnerable equipment, and confirming or receiving training on procedures to be used if a tornado watch or warning is issued.

3252016004|3|DESCRIPTION|1|On July 21, 2016, Engineering personnel determined that a conduit associated with Unit 2 NSW pump "B" was vulnerable to a tornado missile. The affected pump was declared to be inoperable. Immediate compensatory actions were implemented in order to satisfy the conditions for enforcement discretion as set forth in Enforcement Guidance Memorandum (EGM) 15-002 and Interim Staff Guidance (ISG) DSS-ISG-2016-01, Appendix A. With these actions in place, NSW pump 2B was then declared to be operable but nonconforming. Event Causes The vulnerability of the control cables for Unit 2 NSW pump "B" to a tornado missile has existed since original plant construction. Safety Assessment The purpose of the NSW system is to provide cooling water for safety-related plant equipment such as the Emergency Diesel Generators [EK] and Emergency Core Cooling System pump seals and room coolers, and to serve as the Ultimate Heat Sink for the plant. Two occasions in the past three years were identified in which a required NSW pump was inoperable for greater than seven days, twelve hours. During this time, at least one NSW pump remained operable on each unit, ensuring the safety function was met. CSW pumps were also available and can be used to supply NSW headers on both units. Per EGM 15-002, the NRC has analyzed risk generically for tornado-generated missiles. The analysis supports the characterization of the risk as of low significance. Based on this analysis, this event had no adverse impact on the health and safety of the public.

3252016005|1|TITLE|1|Drywell High Range Radiation Monitors Inoperable due to Thermally Induced Current Phenomenon
3252016005|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   On October 3, 2016, Units 1 and 2 were in Mode 1 (i.e., Run mode) at 100 percent of rated thermal power. At that time, Engineering personnel were reviewing the plant response to NRC Information Notice 97-45, Supplement 1, on signal cables for the Drywell High Range Radiation Monitors (DWHRRMs). These cables are susceptible to thermally induced current (TIC), which can degrade the accuracy of DWHRRMs. The review resulted in DWHRRMs being declared inoperable on both units. The DWHRRMs were included in Technical Specifications (TS) ing Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.3.3.1 beginning in 1984. As a result of the TIC effect on the DWHRRM cables, BSEP Unit 1 and Unit 2 have operated longer than the TS allowed completion times for inoperable DWHRRMs. This event is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by the plant TSs. The event resulted from the inherent characteristics of the cables and DWHRRMs. An existing site procedure directs the use of alternate indications for assessment of drywell or fuel cladding conditions, and this procedure will remain in place as a compensatory action. s will include replacing the cables on a schedule to be developed after assessment of available options.

3252016005|3|DESCRIPTION|1|On October 3, 2016, Engineering personnel were re-assessing signal cables for the DWHRRMs. These cables are susceptible to a phenomenon known as thermally induced current (TIC). During transient conditions, TIC can result in connected radiation monitors temporarily not meeting the accuracy requirements of Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.97, Revision 2, "Instrumentation for Light-Water-Cooled Nuclear Power Plants to Assess Plant and Environs Conditions During and Following an Accident." Per RG 1.97, Table 1, note 7, DWHRRMs must be accurate to within a factor of 2. The cables installed in both units at BSEP were previously assumed to be bounded by analysis of Rockbestos cables addressed in Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) Technical Report 110379, "High Range Radiation Monitor Cable Study: Phase 1." It was assumed that the materials in use at BSEP have essentially the same dielectric properties and thermal response as those tested by EPRI. Based on the reported behavior of those materials, calculations predicted that TIC-induced inaccuracy in the DWHRRMs at BSEP would not result in significant impact. Re-assessment of the previous analysis at BSEP cast doubt on the earlier conclusion. The BSEP cables use an insulation material that was not tested by EPRI, and no rigorous basis supported the assumption that the dielectric properties and thermal response would be the same. Engineering personnel, therefore, determined that the previous conclusion about the acceptability of cables used at BSEP lacked sufficiently rigorous justification. This was reported to Operations personnel via Condition Report 2066681. Both BSEP Unit and Unit 2 DWHRRMs were conservatively declared inoperable.

Brunswick Steam Electric Plant (BSEP) Unit 1   005 05000-325  2016 REV NO. - 000 NARRATIVE Event Causes During accident conditions, cables exposed to rapidly changing temperatures can produce electrical currents large enough to cause false indications of high radiation. The TIC phenomenon was made known to the nuclear power industry via NRC Information Notice 97-45, Supplement 1, "Environmental Qualification Deficiency for Cables and Containment Penetration Pigtails." BSEP's initial assessment concluded that the effect of TIC upon the DWHRRMs was too small to appreciably affect their performance in a design basis accident. A new review cast doubt on that conclusion because documentation of the initial assessment contained no rigorous basis for the assumption that BSEP's cables were bounded by those tested by EPRI. Therefore, the DWHRRMs were conservatively declared inoperable.

Therefore, the DWHRRMs were conservatively declared inoperable. Safety Assessment The purpose of the DWHRRMs is to provide operators with indication of radiation conditions inside the primary containment following an accident. Radiation conditions, in turn, are used to assess the integrity of the fuel cladding and provide input for emergency action levels (EALs) to classify a plant emergency. The affected monitors would continue to function despite their susceptibility to TIC, but could indicate radiation levels higher than actual if cables were exposed to increasing temperatures, or lower than actual if cables were exposed to decreasing temperatures. Radiation indications would be inaccurate only during times when temperature in the drywell was rapidly changing. When temperature changes in the drywell grew smaller or stopped, inaccuracy in the DWHRRMs would diminish or vanish entirely. During times when the accuracy of the DWHRRMs might appear questionable, alternative methods of assessing the condition of the fuel are available to operators as provided in existing plant procedure OPLP-37, "Equipment Important to Emergency Preparedness and ERO Response." The DWHRRMs do not control any other structures, systems, or components. Based on this analysis, this event had no adverse impact on the health and safety of the public.

3252016006|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   On December 13, 2016, Units 1 and 2 were in Mode 1 (i.e., Run mode) at 98 percent and 97 percent of rated thermal power, respectively. At that time, shift personnel were notified that structural supports for the 2D Control Room air conditioning system condenser were corroded. An operability assessment found the affected air conditioning system inoperable due to the effect on its seismic qualification. Technical Specifications (TS) 3.7.4, Condition A, was entered. On January 30, 2017, the 1D air conditioning system was found with similar conditions. The duration of the condition and the fact that more than one air conditioning system was inoperable simultaneously resulted in the plant operating in a condition prohibited by the TS and in a loss of the safety function. This event resulted from a lack, in some cases, of station personnel being cognizant of risks related to resolving complex, long-standing issues that continue to degrade over time. All affected support steel was replaced by February 2, 2017. The remaining air conditioner was inspected and found acceptable. Administrative actions will be taken to identify high consequence plant issues and periodically reassess priorities. NRC  366 (06-2016) 1. FACILITY NAME NARRATIVE NRC  366A U.S. (06-2016) Brunswick Steam Electric Plant (BSEP) Unit 1 On December 13, 2016, a periodic inspection was being performed on the Control Building [NA] air conditioner compressors and condensing coils of air conditioner 2D. During the inspection, seismically qualified support members were found to be degraded due to corrosion. This condition was reported to shift personnel in the Main Control Room, and further assessment was initiated. On December 14, 2016, it was determined that the air conditioning unit supported by the corroded members could not be reasonably assured of meeting its seismic qualifications. Therefore, air conditioner 2D was declared inoperable and TS 3.7.4, Condition A was entered. The affected support members for air conditioning unit 2D were replaced under Work Order 20132955 on December 22, 2016, and the TS condition was exited. On December 13, 2016, at 16:27 Eastern Standard Time (EST), Unit 1 was in Mode 1 at approximately 98 percent of rated thermal power. Unit 2 was in Mode 1 at approximately 97 percent of rated thermal power. Other than the components specifically named in this report, no out-of-service equipment contributed to, or affected the course of, this event. This event is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) because Units 1 and 2 were operated in a condition which is prohibited by the Technical Specifications (TS). Specifically, air conditioning units 1D and 2D for the Main Control Room [NA] were inoperable on account of seismically-qualified structural supports being degraded due to corrosion. The duration of the inoperability could not be conclusively determined. Therefore, the air conditioners are conservatively concluded to have been inoperable for longer than the 30 days allowed by TS 3.7.4, Condition A (i.e., one Control Room Air Conditioning subsystem inoperable) and the 72 hours allowed by TS 3.7.4, Condition B (i.e., two Control Room Air Conditioning subsystems inoperable). Since these times were exceeded, the plant was in a condition prohibited by the TS. The condition applies to both units because the air conditioning system serves the shared Control Room. The event is also reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) as an event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. With two air conditioning units inoperable, the safety function of maintaining Control Room habitability could not be assured. The condition applies to both units because the air conditioning system serves the shared Control Room. Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX].

FACILITY NAME NARRATIVE NRC  366A U.S. (06-2016) Brunswick Steam Electric Plant (BSEP) Unit 1 Three 50 percent capacity Control Room air conditioning units provide temperature and humidity control for the Control Room during normal and accident conditions. Two units are normally required to maintain the designed environmental conditions. Since the air conditioning system is required to be seismically qualified, it was declared inoperable until the corroded support members were replaced or repaired. However, during this event, the affected air conditioning system remained capable of performing its function under all but seismic conditions. Per normal operating practices, at least two air conditioning units were always operating, including those times when safety function could not be credited due to compromised seismic qualifications. Additionally, on January 30, 2017, an inspection, as part of the extent of condition, determined that significant corrosion existed on support members for the 1D air conditioner. Therefore, the 1D air conditioner was declared inoperable, and TS 3.7.4, Condition A was entered. On both air conditioners, the duration of the corroded condition could not be established with certainty. The periodic maintenance activity which resulted in identifying the corrosion is performed approximately every six months. The last inspection for the 2D air conditioner took place on May 18, 2016, and was completed satisfactorily at that time. The last inspection for the 1D air conditioner took place on December 1, 2016, and was completed satisfactorily at that time. Since corrosion is typically a slow-acting phenomenon, it is concluded that the affected structural members had degraded to the point of becoming inoperable more than 30 days before discovery (i.e., for longer than the TS allowable out-of-service time). Therefore, the 1D air conditioner should have been recognized as inoperable on December 1, 2016, but was not. Review of plant history revealed that the only remaining Control Room air conditioning unit, the 2E, had been removed from service during the period when the 2D and 1D are believed to have been inoperable due to compromised seismic qualifications. This occurred on October 18, 2016, from 04:42 EST until 11:54 EST for a total of 7 hours, 12 minutes. During this time, only the two seismically unqualified air conditioning unit units remained in operation. The corrosion of steel supports for the two air conditioning units resulted from exposure to a marine environment coupled with trapped moisture. This degraded the protective phenolic coating and then the underlying metal. The apparent cause of the event was determined to be that, in some cases, the station is not cognizant of risks related to resolving complex, long-standing issues that continue to degrade with time.

ABSTRACT (   On December 13, 2016, Units 1 and 2 were in Mode 1 (i.e., Run mode) at 98 percent and 97 percent of rated thermal power, respectively. At that time, shift personnel were notified that structural supports for the 2D Control Room air conditioning system condenser were corroded. An operability assessment found the affected air conditioning system inoperable due to the effect on its seismic qualification. Technical Specifications (TS) 3.7.4, Condition A, was entered. On January 30, 2017, the 1D air conditioning system was found with similar conditions. The duration of the condition and the fact that more than one air conditioning system was inoperable simultaneously resulted in the plant operating in a condition prohibited by the TS and in a loss of the safety function. This event resulted from a lack, in some cases, of station personnel being cognizant of risks related to resolving complex, long-standing issues that continue to degrade over time. All affected support steel was replaced by February 2, 2017. The remaining air conditioner was inspected and found acceptable. Administrative actions will be taken to identify high consequence plant issues and periodically reassess priorities.

3272016001|3|DESCRIPTION|1|I. Plant Operating Conditions Before the Event At the time of the event, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Unit 1 reactor was in Mode 3 due to a forced outage involving the Main Generator. No inoperable systems, structures, or components contributed to this event. II. Description of Events A. Event: On February 9, 2016 at 1415 Eastern Standard Time (EST), SQN Unit 1 experienced an automatic Low Steam Line Pressure Safety Injection (SI) [EIIS Code BQ] signal. The SI resulted in actuation of both trains of Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) [EIIS Codes BQ/BP] and injection into the Reactor Coolant System (RCS) [EIIS Code AB]. Just prior to the event, Operations was preparing to warm the main steam (MS) [EIIS code SB] lines downstream of the main steam isolation valves (MSIV) [EIIS Code ISV] in accordance with System Operating Instructions. The System Operating Instruction allows for MS line warming using up to three MSIV bypass valves based on the RCS temperature. SQN Unit 1 was in Mode 3 with two reactor coolant pumps (RCPs) [EIIS Code P] in service and RCS temperature and pressure at 524 degrees Fahrenheit (F) and 2235 pound per square inch gauge (psig), respectively. The Loop 2 MSIV bypass valve was selected to conduct the MS line warming because it had a running RCP, and the steam pressure trends noted during MSIV bypass valve operability testing provided confidence that RCS temperature and steam generator (SG) [EIIS Code SG] pressure would be adequately controlled. Operations briefed a contingency to close the Loop 2 MSIV bypass valve if plant conditions were not as expected. At approximately 1413 EST, the Loop 2 MSIV bypass valve was opened. The pressure drop in MS Loop 2 was approximately 10 to 12 psig per minute. At-1415 EST, a sudden pressure drop in MS Loop 2 occurred at approximately 50 psig per second and the automatic SI signal initiated. All three MS Loop 2 pressure bi-stables that feed the protective sets actuated up within 20 milliseconds of each other making up the two-out-of-three logic. All safety systems responded as designed and the SI was terminated per procedure. During the warming of MS Loop 2, the water was transferred to piping downstream of the MSIV via the 2-inch MSIV bypass line. Once the vertical sections of piping were void of water, the horizontal sections began emptying and opened a flow path for steam to move into the vertical sections of piping resulting in a steam pressure drop in the Loop 2 SG. Ultrasonic water level measurements identified the MS Loop 2 36-inch horizontal line contained about 18 inches of Page 2 of 7

At this time, both Control Room Emergency Ventilation System (CREVS) trains were declared inoperable in accordance with Technical Specification (TS) 3.7.10, Condition B, due to the inoperability of the Control Room Envelope (CRE). Attempts to close the door were made, and it was identified that a screw had become wedged at the base of the door preventing it from latching. At 0855, the screw was removed and the door verified to close as designed. CREVS was determined to be operable and TS 3.7.10, Condition B was exited.

3272016003|3|DESCRIPTION|1|I. PLANT OPERATING CONDITIONS BEFORE At the time of the event, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Unit 1 and Unit 2 were in Mode 1 at 100 percent rated thermal power. II. DESCRIPTION S A. Event: On May 3, 2016, at 0833 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), Security received an open door [EIIS Code DR] alarm [EllS Code ALM] on a Main Control Room [EIIS Code NA] (MCR) door. At 0847, Security notified the MCR staff that the door would not maintain its seal and would not latch. Security remained in the vicinity of the door the remainder of the time it was unable to close. The leak was approximately a one-eighth-inch opening across the entire sealing surface [SEAL] of the door. As a result, both units entered Technical Specification (TS) 3.7.10, Control Room Emergency Ventilation System [EIIS Code VI](CREVS), Condition B, due to the inoperability of the Control Room Envelope (CRE). During inspection of the sealing surface, a screw was found wedged under the rubber seal on the bottom edge of the door. The screw was the bottom screw from the door latch guard. At 0855, the screw was removed and the door was verified to close as designed. CREVS was declared operable and TS 3.7.10, Condition B, was exited. At 1513, an 8-hour non-emergency event notification (EN 51900) was made to the NRC in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v)(D), as an event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function of structures or systems that are needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. Thisis submitted based on NUREG-1022, Revision 3, Section 3.2.7 guidance which identifies that the requirements of 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) apply when a system that is used to mitigate the consequences of an accident was declared TS inoperable and no redundant system or equipment could be declared operable. Engineering evaluation determined the requirement to support long term occupancy would not have been affected to the point that would have resulted in exceeding the design basis dose assumptions for the MCR operators. Therefore, no loss of safety function occurred. The screw was the bottom screw from the door latch guard and appears to have stripped loose and fallen out. B.

3272016004|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   On May 16, 2016, at 2105 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) identified a nonconforming condition involving the Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) fire dampers installed for Units 1 and 2. Specifically, it has been identified that if a tornado causes a differential pressure across the east and west sides of the EDG Building, the associated ventilation fire dampers have not been analyzed to withstand the corresponding high air flow rate that could result from this condition and could possibly fail in a way that impedes airflow for EDG cooling. On June 8, 2016, at 1526 EDT, SQN determined that a tornado could potentially cause actuation of the EDG crankcase pressure trip due to a low barometric condition that could result in an EDG lockout condition. The EDG lockout condition prevents subsequent EDG starts (normal or emergency) until operators manually reset the lockout condition locally at the EDG. 
3272016004|3|DESCRIPTION|1|S A. Event: On May 16, 2016, at 2105 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) identified a nonconforming condition involving the Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) [EIIS Code EK and DG] fire dampers [EIIS Code DMP] installed for Units 1 and 2. Specifically, it has been identified that if a tornado causes a differential pressure across the east and west sides of the EDG Building, this could create a high airflow rate through the EDG Building ventilation path. The fire dampers for each EDG bay have not been analyzed to withstand high air flows resulting from a tornado and could possibly fail in a way that impedes airflow for EDG cooling. This is an unanalyzed condition that potentially significantly degrades plant safety and could prevent all EDGs from supplying electrical power as designed during a tornado or other similar weather events. On June 8, 2016, at 1526 EDT, another issue was identified involving the potential impact of a tornado on the EDGs. The EDGs are designed with a crankcase pressure trip [EIIS Code PS], which is bypassed during an emergency start. A tornado could potentially cause actuation of the crankcase pressure trip due to a low barometric condition. If an emergency start signal has not previously occurred, then during a tornado, actuation of the crankcase pressure trip would energize the shutdown relay causing an EDG lockout condition. The EDG lockout condition prevents subsequent EDG starts (normal or emergency) until operators manually reset the lockout condition locally at the EDG. This condition places both units in an unanalyzed condition that potentially significantly degrades plant safety and could potentially affect all four EDGs simultaneously. B.

Event: On June 7, 2016, at 0914 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), main control room (MCR) operators were notified by workers, in the field, that a breaker [EllS: BKR] associated with two A train hydrogen ignitors was discovered in the open position. Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.6.8.1 requires greater than or equal to 33 ignitors energized in each train. With the breaker open, there were less than 33 of 34 ignitors operable. Technical Specification (TS) 3.6.8, Hydrogen Mitigation System (HMS) [EllS: BB], Condition A was entered. MCR operators verified that no configuration checklists or clearances configured the breaker to the open position and directed a worker to close the breaker. At 0916 EDT, June 7, 2016, the breaker was closed restoring operability to the two hydrogen ignitors and TS 3.6.8 Condition A was exited. A past operability evaluation completed on June 20, 2016, determined that on March 8, 2016, Unit 1 entered TS 3.6.8, Condition A for a failure associated with the A train HMS. On March 11, 2016, Unit 1 exited TS 3.6.8, Condition A by crediting post maintenance testing following work on the A train HMS. The work performed on March 11, 2016, was the last record of personnel accessing the A train HMS distribution panel. March 11, 2016, is assumed to be the time of breaker misalignment. Therefore, there is no time when 33 or more A train hydrogen ignitors were known to be operable between March 8, 2016 and June 7, 2016. TS 3.6.8, Condition A, Required Action A.1 allows seven days to restore an inoperable HMS train to operable status or Required Action A.2 allows SR 3.6.8.1 to be performed once per 7 days on the operable train. TS 3.6.8, Condition C requires the unit to be in MODE 3 within 6 hours if Required Action and associated Completion Time are not met. Because one train of the HMS was inoperable for 91 days without completing Required Action A.1, A.2, or C.1, this is a condition prohibited by TS and is therefore being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), as any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications.

3272016006|1|TITLE|1|Improper Calibration of Reactor Trip Instrumentation Results in Condition Prohibited by Technical Specifications
3272016006|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   On June 24, 2016, a channel calibration was performed to return the Delta-T/Tavg Channel IV instrument to operable status following digital filter processor card replacement. Instrumentation & Control (I) maintenance personnel performed the channel calibration using a digital multi-meter (DMM) that defaulted to a lower impedance setting than the DMM normally used for the calibration. This impacted the set points. As a result, Delta-T/Tavg Channel IV was adjusted incorrectly and returned to service (the Over temperature delta-T (OTDT) trip function was taken out of the tripped condition) on June 25, 2016, at 0215 Eastern Daylight Time. On June 27, 2016, Reactor Engineering noticed that Tavg had taken a step change lower following the card replacement. On June 29, 2016, operators authorized performance of a functional test for Delta-T/Tavg Channel IV and Unit 1 entered Technical Specification (TS) 3.3.1 Conditions A and E. During the functional test, Delta-T/Tavg was found to be out of TS tolerance. Following adjustment, on June 29 at 2205 operators declared Delta-T/Tavg Channel IV operable. On July 14, a past operability evaluation determined Channel IV of the OTDT trip function was in a noncompliance state longer than allowed by TS. The cause of the event was l maintenance personnel were not trained with the operation of the Fluke 8845A DMM. 
3272016006|3|DESCRIPTION|1|I. PLANT OPERATING CONDITIONS BEFORE At the time of the event, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Unit 1 was in Mode 1 at 100 percent rated thermal power. The condition described in thisdid not impact SQN Unit 2. II. DESCRIPTION S A. Event: On June 23, 2016, at 2015 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), main control room (MCR) operators received an unexpected annunciator [El IS: ANN] for "Protection Set Channel [El IS: CHA] Set Failure." On June 24 at 0100, Instrumentation & Control (I) investigation revealed the digital filter processor card was the cause of the alarm. This affected the Delta-T/Tavg for Channel IV. One of the reactor trips associated with the Delta-T/Tavg channel is the Over temperature delta-T (OTDT) trip function. Unit 1 entered Technical Specification (TS) 3.3.1 Conditions A and E for an inoperable channel of the OTDT trip function. Two digital filter processor cards associated with Delta-T/Tavg Channel IV were replaced due to the failure. For the post maintenance test, functional tests were performed. The reactor protection system [El IS: JC] is sensitive to the input of the test equipment used for checking/calibrating the system. The functional test stated that two different models of digital multi-meters (DMMs) [El IS: MTR] (or equivalent) could be used for the calibration. Both of the identified devices have an input impedance of 10 giga-ohms. l maintenance personnel used an equivalent digital multi-meter (Fluke 8845A DMM) during the performance of the functional tests. This meter can be configured for an input impedance of 10 giga-ohms; however, it defaults to 10 mega-ohms. l maintenance personnel were unaware of the meter's default setting. As a result, Delta-T/Tavg Channel IV was adjusted incorrectly and the channel returned to service on June 25 at 0215. Unit 1 exited TS 3.3.1 Conditions A and E due to Delta-T/Tavg Channel IV being declared operable. On June 27, 2016, Reactor Engineering was trending certain parameters and noticed that Tavg had taken a step change lower by approximately 2 degrees following the digital filter processor card replacement. In order to validate the channel was functioning correctly, on June 29, 2016, operators authorized performance of a functional test for Delta-T/Tavg Channel IV and Unit 1 entered TS 3.3.1 Conditions A and E. During the functional test Delta-T/Tavg was found to be out of TS tolerance. Following adjustment, on June 29 at 2205, operators declared Delta-T/Tavg Channel IV operable. Page 2 of 7

ABSTRACT (   On June 24, 2016, a channel calibration was performed to return the Delta-T/Tavg Channel IV instrument to operable status following digital filter processor card replacement. Instrumentation & Control (I) maintenance personnel performed the channel calibration using a digital multi-meter (DMM) that defaulted to a lower impedance setting than the DMM normally used for the calibration. This impacted the set points. As a result, Delta-T/Tavg Channel IV was adjusted incorrectly and returned to service (the Over temperature delta-T (OTDT) trip function was taken out of the tripped condition) on June 25, 2016, at 0215 Eastern Daylight Time. On June 27, 2016, Reactor Engineering noticed that Tavg had taken a step change lower following the card replacement.

3272016007|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   On August 2, 2016, during review of the Emergency Gas Treatment System (EGTS) circuits, Engineering discovered that the EGTS may automatically swap from the flow control path in A-Auto to the Standby flow control path upon the start of a design basis event (DBE). The intended design of the EGTS swap-over circuit was to detect an actual failure of the control path in A-Auto and swap to the Standby control path. The unnecessary automatic swap to Standby could prevent the EGTS train, configured in A-Auto, from performing its required safety function during a DBE. On August 5, at 1658 eastern daylight time (EDT), the condition was resolved when the automatic swap-over circuit was disabled. On August 17, at 1722 EDT a past operability evaluation determined the configuration of the EGTS flow controllers constituted an unanalyzed condition that significantly degraded plant safety due to the EGTS not meeting single failure criteria. Engineering analysis determined that the failure of both trains of EGTS controllers would not result in exceeding 10 CFR 100 limits. The cause of the event was that the EGTS control circuitry was not designed to account for situations that should have been anticipated.

3272016009|1|TITLE|1|Manual Reactor Trip During Startup Due to a Control Rod Misalignment
3272016009|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   On December 30, 2016, at 1307 Eastern Standard Time (EST), with Unit 1 undergoing a reactor startup, control room operators initiated a manual reactor trip due to a control rod misalignment on control rod, H-6. At the time of the event, the reactor was subcritical. The manual reactor trip was initiated because control rod, H-6, did not respond when rods were being withdrawn. All systems functioned as expected following the trip, with all control rods fully inserting into the core. The apparent cause was the site did not incorporate Westinghouse operating experience (OE) associated with mechanical binding of a stationary gripper into site procedures. As a result, site procedures did not have a method to ensure the stationary grippers were not bound during initial rod movement. No hardware concerns existed. Unit 1 was returned to service on December 31, 2016, with no anomalies occurring during startup. 
3272016009|3|DESCRIPTION|1|I. Plant Operating Conditions Before the Event At the time of the event, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Unit 1 was in Mode 3 following a refueling outage (U1R21). No inoperable systems, structures, or components contributed to this event. II. Description of Event A. Event Summary: On December 30, 2016, at 1302 Eastern Standard Time (EST), SQN Unit 1 was undergoing a reactor startup by withdrawing control rods [EIIS: AA, ROD] for an approach to criticality following a refueling outage. Unit 1 was not critical at the time the manual reactor trip was initiated. During rod withdrawal, operators monitored both the group step counter position indications and rod position indicator (RPI) indications. At 1305, operators observed that control rod, H-6, did not move on withdrawal of associated Control Bank A. Operators verified both indications did not respond to the rod withdrawal demand. Operators entered Abnormal Operating Procedure (A0P)-C.01, Rod Control Malfunctions. At 1307, operators initiated a manual reactor trip. Unit 1 was maintained in Mode 3. Following the reactor trip, all plant safety related equipment operated as designed, and all control rods fully inserted. Auxiliary feed water (AFW) [EIIS: BA] was already supplying feed water to the Steam Generators (SG) [EIIS: SG] however, a feed water isolation signal occurred, as expected due to plant conditions. No complications were experienced during the reactor trip. Control Bank A contains four rods. A review of plant data showed that during the withdrawal of Control Bank A. three of the four controls rods began to step out as demanded. Control rod, H-6, did not move. During troubleshooting activities Control Bank A was withdrawn and all four Control Bank A rods indicated correct movement. An 8-hour non-emergency event notification (EN 52469) was made to the NRC in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A), as any event or condition that results in valid actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(B), except when the actuation results from and is part of a pre-planned sequence during testing or reactor operation. Thisdocuments the reportable event under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A). B. Status of structures, components, or systems that were inoperable at the start of the event and contributed to the event: There were no inoperable structures, components, or systems that contributed to this event. Page 2 of 5
3272016009|4|CAUSE|1|A. Cause of each component or system failure or personnel error: During startup, the stationary gripper of control rod H-6 was mechanically bound during initial control rod latching. Westinghouse provided information that this was a known potential issue during initial control rod movement; however, SQN did not incorporate this operating experience (OE) into site procedures. As a result, SQN procedures did not have a method to ensure the stationary grippers were not bound during initial rod movement. This led to a misaligned rod. B. Cause(s) and circumstances for each human performance related root cause: No human performance issues were identified. IV. Analysis of the Event: Prior to the manual reactor trip, SQN Unit 1 was in Mode 3 following a planned refueling outage. Reactor Coolant System (RCS) [EIIS: AB] pressure and temperature were approximately 2235 pounds per square inch gauge and 548 degrees Fahrenheit. Both the motor driven and the turbine driven AFW pumps, and steam dump valves, and the atmospheric relief valves were available. The plant responded as expected for the conditions of the trip. V. Assessment of Safety Consequences There were no safety consequences as a result of the event. All safety systems functioned as designed during the manual reactor trip and there were no radiation releases due to this event. SQN Unit 1 was not yet critical at the time of this manual reactor trip. The assessment tool used to evaluate risk during startup to the point of reactor criticality is the Equipment Out-of-Service (EGOS) shut down safety model. All defense-in-depth safety requirements evaluated in the SQN shutdown safety model were satisfactorily met at the time of the trip, indicating the overall risk level was low. A. Availability of systems or components that could have performed the same function as the components and systems that failed during the event: No systems or components failed as a result of the manual reactor trip actuation. B. For events that occurred when the reactor was shut down, availability of systems or components needed to shutdown the reactor and maintain safe shutdown conditions, remove residual heat, control the release of radioactive material, or mitigate the consequences of an accident: Page 4 of 5

3312016001|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   On June 19, 2016, while operating at 82% power, two secondary containment access airlock doors were briefly opened simultaneously during a surveillance test. This event was a momentary inoperability of secondary containment integrity, which is an 8 hour reportable event. The Resident Inspector was notified, and an Event Notification made pursuant to 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v)(C). (Reference EN#52022). Following the event, the door controls were adjusted and verified to function properly. On June 29, 2016, at 100% power, workers opened two doors concurrently when entering a secondary containment access airlock. The individuals promptly closed their respective doors. The event was a brief inoperability of secondary containment integrity as above, notifications were made, and repairs completed. (Reference EN#52053) The root causes were determined to be inadequate procedural guidance and equipment design not being able to prevent the simultaneous opening of an inner and outer door at all times, under all possible conditions. s include modification of the interlock tests, and replacement of key door interlock components. These events did not result in a safety system functional failure. There were no radiological releases associated with these events. NRC  366 (02-2014) NRC  366A  U.S. (02-2014) 
3312016001|3|DESCRIPTION|1|I. Description of Event: On June 19, 2016 at 1533, while operating at 82% power, the Control Room Supervisor (CRS) was notified that Door-281 and Door-282, both in Secondary Containment Airlock 153, had been opened concurrently during performance of STP 3.6.4.1-02, "Secondary Containment Airlock Verification," Revision 15, Step 7.1.1.e. This step directed the technician to attempt to open the inner door while the outer door was open The doors being open at the same time caused a failure to meet SR 3.6.4.1.2 to verify that either the outer door(s) or the inner door(s) in each Secondary Containment access opening are closed. The identified condition caused Secondary Containment to be considered inoperable per TS LCO 3.6.4.1. The technician involved immediately closed the doors upon encountering this unexpected condition. This action allowed SR 3.6.4.1.2 to be met, and restored Secondary Containment to an operable status. On June 29, 2016 at 0940, while operating at 100% power, the CRS was notified that Door-239A and Door-246, both in Secondary Containment Airlock 222, the Reactor Building Railroad Airlock, had been opened concurrently. The doors being open at the same time caused a failure to meet SR 3.6.4.1.2 to verify that either the outer door(s) or the inner door(s) in each Secondary Containment access opening are closed. The identified condition caused Secondary Containment to be considered inoperable per TS LCO 3.6.4.1. The individuals involved immediately closed their respective doors upon encountering this unexpected condition. This action allowed SR 3.6.4.1.2 to be met, and restored Secondary Containment to an operable status. Each of the above events resulted in an 8 hour reportable event. In both cases, the Resident Inspector was notified, and an Event Notification was made pursuant to 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v)(C). (References EN #52022 and EN #52053). Secondary containment leak tightness is required to ensure that the release of radioactive materials from the primary containment is restricted to those leakage paths and associated leakage rates assumed in the accident analysis and that fission products entrapped within the secondary containment structure will be treated by the Standby Gas Treatment System prior to discharge to the environment. A Secondary Containment door airlock utilizes an interlock device with an adjustable permanent magnet (mounted on the door), and an electromagnet (on the door frame) arranged in an electrical circuit so that door(s) are held closed and/or are allowed to open after a pushbutton is depressed. Immediately following the event on June 19, troubleshooting adjusted an interlock magnet and by 1651 hours post-maintenance testing had been performed satisfactorily per Surveillance Test Procedure (STP) 3.6.4.1-02, Secondary Containment Airlock Verification.

3312016002|3|DESCRIPTION|1|I. Description of Event: On April 28, 2016, at 0848, while operating at 100% power, with no structures, systems, or components inoperable that contributed to this event, Surveillance Test Procedure (STP) 3.3.6.1-28, Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) System (System Code BN) Steam Line Flow — High Channel Functional Test was started as part of planned testing. The purpose of STP 3.3.6.1-28 is to demonstrate operability of the Steam Line High Differential Pressure (flow) isolation instruments (PDIS-2441 and PDIS-2442) of the RCIC system. During the performance of the STP, relay blocks are installed to inhibit the RCIC turbine trip associated with the RCIC automatic isolation logic under test. Step 7.3.2, which functional checks PDIS-2442, required the installation of three relay blocks, two associated with the inboard isolation signals and one associated with the turbine trip. During the performance of subsequent steps, the RCIC turbine received an unexpected trip signal and MO-2405, RCIC Trip Throttle Valve closed and Control Room annunciator 1C04C (A-5) RCIC MO-2045 Turbine Trip actuated at 1055. Therefore, at 1055 on April 28, 2016, unplanned ing Condition for Operability (LCO), LCO 3.5.3 Condition A, RCIC System Inoperable, was entered. Investigations determined that the relay block for the PDIS-2442 turbine trip signal was placed on the contacts for PDIS-2441. At 1353 on April 28, 2016, the RCIC turbine was reset and RCIC was declared available and LCO 3.5.3 was exited. II. Assessment of Safety Consequences: The safety significance of this event was low. During the time that RCIC was unavailable, all of the Emergency Core Cooling Systems (High Pressure Coolant Injection, Core Spray, and Low Pressure Coolant Injection) that would have initiated in response to an accident or transient were operable. All components and systems actuated as designed due to this event. This event resulted in a Safety System Functional Failure and a Maintenance Preventable Functional Failure under the Maintenance Rule. III. Cause of Event: An Apparent Cause Evaluation (ACE) was completed for this event. The ACE determined that the direct cause of the RCIC turbine trip was the incorrect installation of relay block associated with inhibiting the RCIC turbine trip associated with the RCIC automatic isolation logic under test.

Description of Event: On October 18, 2016, with the unit shutdown for a planned refueling outage (Mode 5, Refueling, 0% power), an evaluation of data from the scheduled Main Steam Line Isolation Valve (MSIV) (System Code SB) and Main Steam Line Drain valve penetration Local Leak Rate Testing (LLRT) determined the 'as found' maximum pathway leakage for the 'B' Inboard MSIV, CV-4415, and the Outboard Main Steam Line Drain valve, MO-4424, in excess of the Technical Specification (TS) 3.6.1.3 leakage limit of 5 100 scfh for a single MSIV and 5 200 scfh for combined pathway leakage. II. Assessment of Safety Consequences: Reportability Evaluation CV-4415 'as found' leakage was measured at 253.8 scfh. TS Surveillance (SR) 3.6.1.3.9 requires verification of leakage rate through each MSIV is 5_ 100 scfh and that the combined maximum pathway leakage rate for all four main steam lines is 5 200 scfh when tested at ?. 24 psig. Failure to meet this SR requires entry into LCO 3.6.1.3.9, Condition D, restore leakage to within limits within 8 hours, or be in MODE 3 within 12 hours. The as found results exceeded the TS SR limit for individual and combined MSIV leakage and is reportable as a condition prohibited by TS and requires a Licensed Event Report (LER) to be submitted under 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). MO-4424 'as found' leakage was measured at 710 scfh. As stated in Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) Section 6.7.1, the total main steam pathway, which includes the four main steam lines and the inboard MSIV Drain Line, is limited to 200 scfh (i.e., the main steam line drains are included in the total leakage limit for all MSIVs). Therefore, the Main Steam Line Drains valve LLRT failures are included in this LER. Safety Significance The Main Steam system conducts steam from the reactor vessel through the primary containment to the main turbine. In performing this function, it serves as part of the primary boundary to prevent radioactive release to the surrounding environment. Duane Arnold Energy Center 05000-331

3332016001|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   On January 23, 2016, James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant (JAF) was ascending in power when screenwell water level started to lower. At 89 percent power, at 22:23, Operators began taking compensatory measures to reduce power and mitigate water level lowering. At 22:40, a manual scram was initiated. The scram was complicated by a residual transfer that resulted in non-vital equipment trips. This event resulted in the manual actuation of the Reactor Protection System, High Pressure Coolant Injection, Reactor Core Isolation Cooling, Main Steam Isolation Valves and automatic actuation of Emergency Diesel Generators, Emergency Service Water, and containment isolations in multiple systems, reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A). The lowering screenwell water level was caused by frazil ice blockage at the intake structure. The frazil ice stopped affecting screenwell water level after the manual scram. 
3332016001|3|DESCRIPTION|1|Background James A. FitzPatrick's (JAF) Ultimate Heat Sink [EllS designation: BS] is Lake Ontario. Water from Lake Ontario is transported via a water intake structure. The intake structure is an underwater concrete structure on the lakebed. Lake water enters the intake structure, travels through the intake tunnel, and enters the intake bay. The intake bay is located inside the screen house building. The enclosed intake bay area is also called the screenwell. Located in the screenwell area, downstream of trash racks and rotating screens, are three Circulating Water pumps [KE], three Normal Service Water (NSW) pumps [KG], two Emergency Service Water (ESW) pumps [BI], four Residual Heat Removal Service Water (RHRSW) pumps [BI] and two Fire pumps [KP]. One Fire pump is upstream of the trash racks. The Circulating Water pumps supply cooling to the main condenser and are each operated at 133,000 gpm. NSW pumps are each rated at 17,800 gpm and supply cooling to plant loads during normal operating conditions. ESW pumps supply cooling to safety-related loads during both normal and accident conditions and are rated at 3,700 gpm each. RHRSW pumps, rated at 4,000 gpm each, supply cooling to the RHR heat exchangers. Intake / screenwell water level is normally slightly lower than lake level due to flow head losses (generally at about 244 feet elevation depending on seasonal changes). The screenwell level is monitored in the control room and on Operator rounds. The NSW, ESW, and RHRSW pumps require a minimum water elevation at 235 feet elevation for safe operation. The Circulating Water and the Fire pumps require a minimum water elevation of 239 feet 6 inches for safe operation. Frazil ice is a natural phenomenon in lakes and water ways, including Lake Ontario, when water freezes into loosely formed needle-like crystals. Surface water becomes supercooled when it loses heat rapidly to cold air without freezing. Turbulence, caused by winds, can mix the supercooled water throughout a body of water. The supercooled water encourages the formation of small ice crystals (frazil ice). Ice generally floats, but due to frazil ice's small size relative to current speeds, it can be carried to the bottom very easily. Frazil ice is more likely to occur when air temperatures decrease below freezing and when there is little ice cover on the lake, no cloud cover, winds are present, and the sun has set. Frazil ice has a negative impact on plant operations when it adheres to the intake structure. Supercooled water can reduce the intake structure surface temperatures below freezing then ice forms directly on the surface or frazil ice slush could drift into the structure and adhere to it. Since the intake structure actively draws in water it may draw in frazil ice. The intake structure entrance includes rack bars to screen large debris, consisting of 88 metal bars. These metal bars would normally be an optimal surface for frazil ice accumulation; however, deicing heaters are located in each.

3332016002|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   On January 23, 2016, James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant (JAF) initiated a manual Scram in response to lowering screenwell water level due to frazil ice blockage, and subsequently closed the Main Steam Isolation Valves (MSIV).

3332016002|3|DESCRIPTION|1|Background James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant (JAF) has four main steam lines [El IS identifier: SB] between the reactor and the main turbine [TA]. These lines are designed to isolate in the event of design basis accidents. In the event of a main steam line break, the isolation prevents further radiological release. In the event of a loss of coolant (LOCA) accident, they isolate to maintain coolant inside of containment. Two isolation valves are provided in series in a horizontal run of each main steam line, as close as practical to the primary containment. One inside (inboard) and the other outside (outboard) together form part of the primary containment barrier for Reactor Coolant System breaks inside the containment and part of the Reactor Coolant Pressure Boundary for main steam line breaks outside the primary containment. The closure time of the main steam isolation valves (MSIVs) is a significant variable from a radiological standpoint. The MSIVs are required to close within 3 to 5 seconds after signal generation. The closure speed is designed to be slower than 3 seconds in order to lessen the pressure transient caused by an inadvertent simultaneous closure of all steam lines. The closure speed is designed to be faster than 5 second to minimize the release of fission products to the environment and retain reactor coolant. Each MSIV is controlled by a solenoid I SUPPLY I valve cluster assembly (SVCA). There are three solenoid valves within the AC PILOT 2 WAY SVCA; AC Pilot solenoid valve, AC Test solenoid valve and a DC pilot solenoid valve. These three solenoids port air to and from other control TEST 3 WAY valves. The normally energized AC pilot valve and DC pilot valve must move to the de-energized position to change the DC PILOT 4 WAY position of the 2 and 4 way valves MSIV ACTUATOR which closes the MSIV. When both solenoids are de-energized, the below ♦ NORMAL CLOSED piston operator space is vented. Simultaneously, the above piston operator space is pressurized, thus assisting the spring in closing the MSIV. This licensee event report (LER) addresses a slow closure response for outboard MSIV 29A0V-86B and 29A0V-86C due to their DC pilot solenoid valves 2950V-86B3 and 2950V-86C3. Event Description On January 23, 2016, control room Operators inserted a manual Scram due to lowering intake levels resulting from frazil ice conditions in Lake Ontario. As part of the plant shutdown the MSIVs were closed. The closing time for the "B" outboard MSIV 29A0V-86B, was slow by as much as 9 seconds after the other valves indicated closed. The SVCA and 4-way valve were replaced and 29A0V-86B then stroked satisfactorily. On January 27, 2016, the MSIV fast closure test ST-1B was performed on all MSIVs. MSIV 29A0V-86C closed in 6.9 seconds and all other MSIVs tested satisfactorily. The SVCA and 4-way valve were replaced and 29A0V-86C then stroked satisfactorily. CLOSED

3332016003|3|DESCRIPTION|1|Background The Secondary Containment [EIIS identifier: NG] boundary surrounds the primary containment and refueling equipment. The boundary forms a control volume to contain, dilute, and hold up fission products. The Secondary Containment consists of four systems which include the Reactor Building, the Reactor Building Isolation and Control System, the Standby Gas Treatment System, and the Main Stack. Secondary Containment is designed to provide containment for postulated design basis accident scenarios: loss-of-coolant accident and refueling (fuel handling) accident. Since pressure may increase in Secondary Containment relative to the environmental pressure, support systems are required to maintain a differential pressure vacuum such that external atmosphere would leak into containment rather than fission products leak out. The systems which maintain a differential pressure vacuum inside Secondary Containment include the normal Reactor Building Ventilation and Cooling (RBV) System [VA] (during normal plant operations) and the safety-related Standby Gas Treatment (SBGT) System [BH] for post-accident conditions. Technical Specification (TS) Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.6.4.1.3 requires one Secondary Containment access door in each access opening to remain closed. Failure to meet this SR results in the Secondary Containment ing Condition for Operation (LCO) not being met, and requires the Secondary Containment to be declared Inoperable. Event Description On June 7, 2016, with the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant (JAF) operating at 100 percent power, members of the Maintenance and Security departments simultaneously entered the northeast Secondary Containment airlock on Reactor Building Elevation 272'. This resulted in the concurrent opening of the airlock doors. This condition was corrected within approximately two (2) seconds. At the time of the closure of either door, secondary containment integrity was restored as the SR for one door closed was met, and no other SRs (such as negative pressure) were being exceeded. For the condition in which Secondary Containment did not meet the Technical Specification (TS) Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.6.4.1.3 for at least one door in secondary containment access opening being closed, the TS ing Condition of Operation (LCO) 3.6.4.1 required action was to restore secondary containment to Operable status in 4 hours. An NRC notification was made via ENS 51985. This Licensing Event Report (LER) is being submitted per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C) as a condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of safety function to control the release of radioactive material.

A fault in transformer 71T-5 caused a trip of circuit breaker 71-10340. Power was lost to 2 of 3 Reactor Building Closed Loop Cooling (RBCLC) pumps and 2 of 3 lube oil pumps for the Motor-Generator (MG) Set for 'A' Reactor Water Recirculation (RWR). The 'A' RWR pump tripped immediately causing reactor power to reduce to approximately 50%. The remaining RBCLC pump was inadequate to maintain the MG Set fluid drive oil temperature for the 'B' RWR pump so Operators initiated a manual scram at 1236. This event is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A). The power loss also affected Reactor Building Ventilation (RBV). This system supports the requirement of Technical Specification Surveillance Requirement 3.6.4.1.1 for a differential pressure in Secondary Containment.

The fan outlet isolation damper actuator 70MOD-108A(OP) failed to give the fully-open permissive signal to start the fan. Gentle pressure on the actuator linkage allowed the fan to start. Prior to this, on August 16, 2016, during post-maintenance testing, 70FN-4A did not start. Troubleshooting adjusted the linkage and the fan started as appropriate. However, the intermittent fan start issue was caused by the degraded damper actuator 70MOD-108A(OP). 
3332016005|3|DESCRIPTION|1|Background The James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant (JAF) Control Room Air Conditioning (AC) System [EllS identifier: VI] and the Control Room Emergency Ventilation Air Supply (CREVAS) System [VI] (a mode of the Control Room AC) provides a protected environment from which occupants can control the plant during normal conditions and following an uncontrolled release of radioactivity, hazardous chemicals, or smoke. The Control Room AC System and CREVAS System consists of two redundant subsystems that provide recirculated control room air. A single subsystem is sufficient to maintain a suitable control room environment for a sustained occupancy of 20 persons. Each subsystem consists of air handling units, recirculation exhaust fans, air handling unit fans, ductwork, dampers, and associated Instrumentation and controls; and, each CREVAS subsystem consists of a series of filters, a control room emergency air supply fan, valves or dampers, doors, barriers and instrumentation. The recirculation / exhaust fans consist of two full capacity fans for the Control Room. The intake air supply is mixed with air from one of the recirculation / exhaust fans before it is recirculated back to the room. One Control Room exhaust fan runs at all times to support the normal or emergency mode while the other fan is on standby. Normally these exhaust fans are swapped manually. An automatic start function occurs only if the running exhaust fan stops. This Licensee Event Report (LER) addresses the ability to start one of the Control Room recirculation / exhaust fans (70FN-4A). Event Description On September 19, 2016, JAF was at 54 percent power when the Control Room Ventilation recirculation / exhaust fan lineup was being changed to place 70FN-4A inservice when it did not start as expected. A second attempt to start the fan was successful when gentle pressure was applied to assist the linkage between the damper (70MOD-108A) and motor actuator (70MOD-108A(OP)). This damper is located on the outlet to 70FN-4A. To maintain the operability of 70FN-4A, it was placed in service as the lead fan with 70FN-4B in standby. In addition, a manual Operator compensatory action was developed to have an Operator dispatched to assist the damper linkage in the event that an exhaust fan does not start. This compensatory action requires a short transit from the Control Room to the Control Room Ventilation Equipment room. Event Analysis The switch in the Control Room begins the sequence to start the fan (70FN-4A) by opening its associated damper (70MOD-108A). The circuit logic starts the fan after a time delay so the damper has time to open; but, it only starts the fan if there is a permissive signal that the damper has fully opened. The open permissive signal originates from a position switch integral / internal to the damper actuator (70MOD-108A(OP)) itself. When gentle pressure was applied to assist the damper linkage during the event, it caused the actuator to complete its motion and close the contact for the permissive signal and initiate the fan start. Prior to this event, on August 16, 2016, 70FN-4A did not start during post maintenance testing. In addition, the time delay start logic relay (70-62-1CRVA04) was found out-of-tolerance and damper position indication in the Control Room was dual. Indication in the Control Room for damper position comes from position switches 70PNS-108A1 and 70PNS-108A2. However, these position switches are for indication only and they do not

3352016001|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   On June 2, 2016, St. Lucie Units 1 and 2 were in Mode 1 at 100% power. At 1500 hours FPL declared the containment high range radiation monitors (CHRRMs) inoperable on both Units. FPL determined that the resolution of the-.NRC Information Notice (IN) 97-45 industry Operating Experience (OE) concerning CHRRMs cabling was less than adequate. The assumed CHRRMs design accuracy could not be assured during some postulated design basis accidents due to the errors introduced by thermal induced currents and water intrusion/cable blistering within the associated detectors' cabling, resulting in inoperable CHRRMs. The Technical Specifications (TSs) require pre-planned alternate means for containment radiation monitoring for inoperable CHRRMs; these requirements were not implemented until June 2016. FPL also submitted a TS 6.9.2 Special Report for two channels of inoperable CHRRMs. This legacy event was caused by the inadequate evaluation and improper tracking of actions required to fully close the nonconformance identified in the 1997 Information Notice. CHRRMs are used for information, they are not used to control radioactive releases or mitigate accidents. Their inoperability had no significant impact on the health and safety of the public.

The limiting condition for operation (LCO) for Technical Specification (TS) 3.3.3.1, Action b, Table 3.3-6, Action 15 (Unit 1) and Action 27 (Unit 2), are essentially the same and state that: "With the number of channels OPERABLE [OPERABLE Channels — Unit 2] less than required by the Minimum Channels OPERABLE requirement, either restore the inoperable Channel(s) to OPERABLE status within 72 hours, or: 1) Initiate the preplanned alternate method of monitoring the appropriate parameter(s), and 2) Prepare and submit a Special Report to the Commission pursuant to Specification 6.9.2 within 14 days following the event outlining the action taken, the cause of the inoperability and the plans and schedule for restoring the system to OPERABLE status." On June 4, 2016 the preplanned alternate methods for monitoring containment radiation levels were implemented in accordance with operator night orders and enhancements made to plant procedure EPG-08, "Monitoring Plant Equipment Important to the Radiological Emergency Plan," Attachment 2, "Alternate Monitoring Method with the CHRRM Channels Inoperable." The CHRRMs are used as one of several diverse methods for evaluating emergency action levels (EALs) for the Loss of Fuel Clad Barrier and for the Potential Loss of Primary Containment Barrier in the St. Lucie Emergency Plan (EPlan). Unit differences necessitate different strategies for the Loss of Fuel Clad Barrier EAL determined by CHRRMs indication. These preplanned alternate methods use: • the containment isolation radiation monitors (Unit 1), or • the diverse indications as defined in the EAL table to evaluate the loss of the fuel clad barrier (Unit 2) (e.g. core exit thermocouples, Dose Equivalent 1-131, loss of the core heat removal safety function and entry into emergency operating procedure EOP-15) The Potential Loss of Primary Containment Barrier EAL determined by CHRRMs indication will be provided in part by the use of the post-LOCA radiation monitors with outside containment radiation levels that correlate to the radiation levels inside containment. Two inoperable CHRRMs require that the NRC be notified of this condition in accordance with TS 6.9.2. FPL submitted the special report on July 16, 2016, in FPL letter L-2016-127. Cause of the Event In 1997 and 1998, NRC Information Notice (IN) 97-45 and its supplement 1 notified the industry that the CHRRMs were subject to erratic behavior and possible failure because the expected post-accident environmental conditions within containment could adversely affect the cabling system. FPL's initial disposition of the issue considered the CHRRMs operable due to the short time period the effects lasted, the bounded containment LOCA temperature profiles, and the consideration of the diverse means available for accomplishing post-accident dose assessment, core damage assessment, and emergency plan (EPlan) actions.

At 1500 hours FPL declared the containment high range radiation monitors (CHRRMs) inoperable on both Units. FPL determined that the resolution of the-.NRC Information Notice (IN) 97-45 industry Operating Experience (OE) concerning CHRRMs cabling was less than adequate. The assumed CHRRMs design accuracy could not be assured during some postulated design basis accidents due to the errors introduced by thermal induced currents and water intrusion/cable blistering within the associated detectors' cabling, resulting in inoperable CHRRMs. The Technical Specifications (TSs) require pre-planned alternate means for containment radiation monitoring for inoperable CHRRMs; these requirements were not implemented until June 2016. FPL also submitted a TS 6.9.2 Special Report for two channels of inoperable CHRRMs. This legacy event was caused by the inadequate evaluation and improper tracking of actions required to fully close the nonconformance identified in the 1997 Information Notice. CHRRMs are used for information, they are not used to control radioactive releases or mitigate accidents. Their inoperability had no significant impact on the health and safety of the public. FPL plans to replace the CHRRMs cabling susceptible to the phenomenon identified in NRC Information Notice 97-45 and its supplement 1.

3352016002|3|DESCRIPTION|1|Description of the Event On August 5, 2016, Unit 1 was in Mode 5 and in the process of restarting following a maintenance outage. On August 5, 2016, Unit 1 entered Mode 4 at 0943, Operators were conducting activities to cool down the shutdown cooling system after removing the system from service. With Unit 1 in Mode 4, Operators observed the Reactor Coolant System (RCS) [AB] Pressurizer level lowering when opening of HCV-3618, Safety Injection Loop 1A2 Check Valve Leakage Isolation Valve, as part of the procedure for system restoration. Based on the lowering Pressurizer level, operators closed HCV-3618. This action arrested the Pressurizer level reduction by isolating the internally leaking check valve V3217 [ISV:AB] and stopping RCS leakage to the Refueling Water Tank (RN/VT). The flow path was promptly identified and isolated prior to any alarms or automatic system actuations. Procedural guidance to quantify the seat leakage required establishing a differential pressure which did not exist at current conditions. A seat leakage test was planned when RCS pressure could be established to meet the required conditions. Unit 1 entered Mode 3 on August 6, 2016. On August 7, 2016 with the RCS at the normal operating pressure 2250 psia, test personnel were unable to achieve an appropriate differential pressure to allow the performance of a seat leak test of V3217, and the seat leak test was halted. On August 7, 2016, at 1600, V3217 was declared inoperable, and Unit 1 entered The Technical Specification action statement (TSAS) 3.4.6.2.e, RCS pressure isolation valve leakage. The action statement required that leakage be reduced to within limits within 4 hours or be in at least HOT STANDBY within 6 hours and in COLD SHUTDOWN within the following 30 hours. During the allowed 4 hours, a second attempt was made to leak check V3217, but the required differential pressure could not be achieved. Unit 1 entered Mode 4 on August 8, 2016, at 0233, and entered Mode 5 on August 8, 2016, at 2003. Unit 1 remained in Mode 5 until repairs to V3217 were completed. Cause The internal leakage past V3217 was caused by inadequate contractor maintenance practices and procedures that did not ensure V3217 was within acceptable tolerances and correctly assembled. It was identified that maintenance performed in 2013 incorrectly assembled internal valve bushings, and bushing spacers were not installed per the design. This resulted in excessive internal wear and misalignment. A second root cause identified that V3217 is susceptible to accelerated wear if differential pressure is not maintained across the seat. This was not recognized and incorporated into the overall valve maintenance strategy.

3352016003|1|TITLE|1|Generator Lockout Relay Actuation During Power Ascension Results in Reactor Trip
3352016003|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   On August 21, 2016, during Unit 1 restart following a maintenance outage, an unexpected actuation of the Main Generator Inadvertent Energization Lockout Relay caused the main generator to trip, resulting in an automatic reactor trip. The generator lockout prevented the automatic transfer of station auxiliaries to the available startup transformer power, requiring the emergency diesel generators to start and power the safety related buses. Reactor coolant pumps normally powered through the non-safety buses were deenergized, and decay heat removal was via natural circulation and Auxiliary Feed water. The lockout relay actuation was caused by a latent error introduced during a 2013 design modification where the maintenance configuration control procedure did not prevent a wire from being inadvertently removed from the circuit. 
3352016003|3|DESCRIPTION|1|Description of the Event On August 21, 2016 St. Lucie Unit 1 was in in Mode 1 performing normal power ascension evolutions following a maintenance outage. At 1926 EDT when the main generator [EL] reached approximately 8000 amps and at 38% reactor power, unexpected actuation of the Main Generator Inadvertent Energization Lockout Relay [86:EL] caused the main generator to trip, resulting in an automatic reactor trip. The reactor trip was complicated by the generator lockout preventing the automatic transfer of station auxiliaries to the available startup transformer power, requiring the emergency diesel generators to automatically start and power the safety related buses. Reactor coolant pumps normally powered through the non-safety buses were deenergized, and decay heat removal was via natural circulation and manual control of Auxiliary Feed water. Due to the blocked automatic transfer to the available startup transformer power, the electric driven main feed water pumps were not available until power to the non-safety related buses was restored. Other than the generator lockout, all systems functioned as designed, and the plant stabilized in Mode 3. Operators declared a Notice of Unusual Event (NUE). The declaration of the NUE was based on the lockout relay preventing the automatic transfer to available startup transformer power. The transfer of power was required to be performed manually by operators following verification of availability. Offsite power remained available at the switchyard throughout the event, and operators restored power to the safety and non-safety related buses from the startup transformers at 2036 and restarted reactor coolant pumps. The unusual event was terminated at 2125 hours following restoration of forced cooling within the reactor coolant system. Unit 2 was unaffected and remained at 100% power. Cause The direct cause of this event was a latent error introduced during a 2013 design modification when a wire for the inadvertent energization lockout relay reset circuit was incorrectly removed as part of a modification to the synchronization circuit. This modification allowed the relay to remain energized and undetected following manual synchronization to the grid. The root cause of this event was the maintenance configuration control procedure did not require sufficient detail to be included in the work instructions for modifying synchronization selector switch SS-888. More specifically, the maintenance configuration control procedure lacked requirements to adequately document and verify the lifting and landing of the wires manipulated and did not require that the as-left configuration match exactly the post modification as-designed configuration.

3412016002|1|TITLE|1|Both Residual Heat Removal Low Pressure Coolant Injection Divisions Inoperable Due to Inoperable Injection Valve
3412016002|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   On January 22, 2016, at 1923 EST, both divisions of the Residual Heat Removal (RHR) system were declared inoperable for the Low Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI) mode of operation due to a failure of the division 1 LPCI outboard injection motor operated valve (MOV), El 1 50F017A. While performing the division 1 RHR pump and valve operability surveillance test, E1150F017A closed properly but failed to open during its required stroke time test. With this valve closed and unable to automatically open, LPCI injection into the Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) from both divisions of RHR would be prevented if the LPCI loop select logic selected the division 1 recirculation loop for injection; therefore, this failure rendered both divisions of RHR inoperable for the LPCI function. Technical Specification limiting condition for operation (LCO) 3.5.1, Condition K, was entered, which requires immediate entry into LCO 3.0.3. The cause of the failure was subsequently identified as a foreign material (screw) that affected the function of the MOV contactor. The root cause was determined to be less than adequate inspection procedures and susceptibility of the contactor to foreign material. Inspection of all other susceptible equipment is ongoing to tighten loose screws and a modification is planned to install Foreign Material Exclusion (FME) barriers. NRC  366 (11-2015) 1.

Fermi 2 341    REV NO. 2016 002 00 Initial Plant Conditions: Mode 1 Reactor Power 100 percent There were no inoperable Structures, Systems, or Components at the start of the event that contributed to the event. Description of the Event On January 22, 2016, at 1923 EST, both divisions of Residual Heat Removal (RHR) [BO] were declared inoperable for the Low Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI) mode of operation due to a failure of the division 1 LPCI outboard injection motor operated valve [ISV], El 1 50F017A. While performing the division 1 RHR pump and valve operability surveillance test, El 150F017A closed properly but failed to open during its required stroke time test. The Fermi 2 accident analysis takes credit for the proper operation of the LPCI loop select logic during a loss of coolant accident (LOCA). The loss of coolant event involves the postulation of a spectrum of piping breaks inside the primary containment, varying in size, type, and location. The most severe nuclear system effects and the greatest release of material to the primary containment result from a complete circumferential break of one of the two reactor recirculation loop [AD] pipe lines. This is the design basis accident (DBA). Since the LPCI system injects water into the reactor vessel [RPV] through the discharge piping of one of the recirculation loops, a loop selection logic is provided to ensure that the water is injected into an unbroken loop. The loop selection logic compares pressure on the two recirculation loops. A broken loop will indicate a lower pressure than an unbroken loop. The loop selection logic directs the LPCI injection into the high pressure (unbroken) loop. The loop selection is effected through the operation of the RHR injection valves. Valve E1150F017A is a normally open RHR injection valve in series with the inboard El 1 50F015A valve. These valves control the RHR LPCI flow into reactor recirculation loop A. Because the valve failed in the closed position, flow would be inhibited into the A recirculation loop for scenarios where a break is detected in loop B. Therefore, both divisions of RHR were declared inoperable for the LPCI function at 1923 EST on January 22, 2016. Technical Specification 3.5.1, Condition K was invoked and limiting condition for operation (LCO) 3.0.3 was immediately entered. Trouble shooting determined that the control power [JS] closing contactor did not have full freedom of movement because of foreign material. The contactor was removed from the Motor Control Center (MCC) and was manually cycled on a workbench. While manually cycling the contactor, a screw fell out of the contactor. The screw apparently fell into the contactor from a Control Relay (CR) located above the contactor in the MCC. At approximately 2143 EST, the El 150F017A valve was re-tested satisfactorily. The valve properly closed and opened, meeting required Inservice Inspection (ISI) stroke time acceptance criteria. At 2145 EST, both divisions of RHR were declared operable for the LPCI and LCO 3.5.1, Condition K and. LCO 3.0.3 were exited. Page 2 of 4 NRC  366A U.S. (11-2015)

3412016005|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   On August 2, 2016, at 1015 EDT, while restoring the east train of Reactor Building Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (RBHVAC) after a surveillance test on Division 2 Standby Gas Treatment System (SGTS), the Technical Specification (TS) for the Secondary Containment (SC) pressure boundary was not met for approximately 1 second. The maximum SC pressure observed was approximately 0.120 inches of vacuum water column. The TS requirement is to maintain SC vacuum greater than or equal to 0.125 inches of vacuum water column for SC operability. All plant equipment responded as required to the changing conditions and RBHVAC and SGTS already in operation returned the SC pressure to within the TS limits; therefore, the ing Condition for Operation was met. There were no safety consequences or radiological releases associated with this event.

DESCRIPTION : On August 2, 2016, at 1015 EDT, while restoring the east train of Reactor Building Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (RBHVAC) [[VA]] after a surveillance test on Division 2 Standby Gas Treatment System (SGTS) [[BH]], the Technical Specification (TS) for the Secondary Containment (SC) [[NH]] pressure boundary was not met for a duration of approximately 1 second. The maximum SC pressure observed during the event was approximately 0.120 inches of vacuum water column. In addition to the restart of RBHVAC, high winds were noted at the time that SC was lost. There are two recorder [[PR]] divisions to monitor SC pressure. The Division 2 recorder indicated 0.120 inches of vacuum water column. The Division 1 recorder indication was within TS limits throughout this event, with a maximum SC pressure of 0.150 inches of vacuum water column. SC pressure was immediately returned to within the TS limit by RBHVAC and SGTS already in operation. There were no equipment failures or abnormal equipment indications observed during the RBHVAC startup sequence. There were no radiological releases associated with this event. The TS requirement is to maintain secondary containment vacuum greater than or equal to 0.125 inches of vacuum water column (TS Surveillance Requirement 3.6.4.1.1) for SC operability. An 8-hour event notification (EN 52146) was made to the NRC based on meeting the reporting criteria of Title 10 Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) 50.72(b)(3)(v)(C) as an event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function needed to control the release of radioactive material. This Licensee Event Report (LER) is being made under the corresponding requirement in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C). SIGNIFICANT SAFETY CONSEQUENCES IMPLICATIONS: There were no safety consequences or radiological releases associated with this event. At no time during this event was there a potential for endangering the public health and safety. The specified safety function of the SC is to contain, dilute, and hold up fission products that may leak from primary containment following a Design Basis Accident (DBA). In conjunction with operation of the SGTS and closure of certain valves [[V]] whose lines penetrate the SC, the SC is designed to reduce the activity level of the fission products prior to release to the environment and to isolate and contain fission products that are released during certain operations that take place inside primary containment, when primary containment is not required to be OPERABLE, or that take place outside primary containment. It is possible for the pressure in the control volume to rise relative to the environmental pressure (e.g., due to pump [[P]] and motor [[MO]] heat load additions). To prevent ground level exfiltration while allowing the SC to be designed as a conventional structure, the SC requires support systems to maintain the control volume pressure at less than the external pressure. For the SC to be considered OPERABLE, it must have adequate leak tightness to ensure that the required vacuum can be established and maintained.

ABSTRACT (   On August 2, 2016, at 1015 EDT, while restoring the east train of Reactor Building Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (RBHVAC) after a surveillance test on Division 2 Standby Gas Treatment System (SGTS), the Technical Specification (TS) for the Secondary Containment (SC) pressure boundary was not met for approximately 1 second. The maximum SC pressure observed was approximately 0.120 inches of vacuum water column. The TS requirement is to maintain SC vacuum greater than or equal to 0.125 inches of vacuum water column for SC operability. All plant equipment responded as required to the changing conditions and RBHVAC and SGTS already in operation returned the SC pressure to within the TS limits; therefore, the ing Condition for Operation was met. There were no safety consequences or radiological releases associated with this event. The cause of this momentary loss of SC was determined to be the combined effect of the RBHVAC startup sequence with high winds outside the Reactor Building (RB). For

The MDCT fans have a brake system to prevent fan overspeed during a tornado. Fermi 2 procedures had directed personnel to declare the MDCT fans and UHS reservoir inoperable due to nonfunctionality of the brake system only if a tornado watch or warning was in effect for the area near Fermi 2. The correct interpretation of TS 3.7.2 would be to declare the MDCT fans and UHS reservoir inoperable any time the brake system was nonfunctional. Following discovery of the inadequate interpretation of TS, a review of the brake system for the past three years was performed. The review identified 15 occurrences where the brake system was nonfunctional and should have resulted in entry to TS 3.7.2.

3412016006|3|DESCRIPTION|1|INITIAL PLANT CONDITIONS Mode — 1 Reactor Power — 53 percent There were no structures, systems, or components (SSCs) that were inoperable at the start of this event that contributed to this event. DESCRIPTION At 1629 EDT on August 25, 2016, while operating in Mode 1 at 53 percent power, it was determined that DTE Electric Company (DTE) had been utilizing an inadequate interpretation of Technical Specifications (TS) pertaining to the Mechanical Draft Cooling Tower (MDCT) [[CTW]] fan [[FAN]] brake [[BRK]] system. TS 3.7.2 requires the Ultimate Heat Sink (UHS) [[BS]] reservoir to be operable in Modes 1, 2 and 3. The UHS operability requirements in Modes 4 and 5 are determined by the systems the UHS supports. The UHS reservoir is divided into two one-half capacity reservoirs, corresponding to Division 1 and Division 2. Each reservoir is the cooling source for that division's service water subsystems, including the service water for the Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs) [[DG]]. A two-cell MDCT is located above each of the one-half capacity reservoirs. Each cell is equipped with a MDCT fan. Two MDCT fans above each one-half capacity reservoir are required for it to be considered operable. The "A" and "C" MDCT fans are in Division 1 and the "B" and "D" fans are in Division 2. The MDCT fans have a brake system to prevent overspeed from a design basis tornado as described in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) Section 9.2.5.2.2. Thus the fan brakes are a design feature of the fans and their functionality impacts the operability of the MDCT fans and therefore the UHS. Contrary to this, a DTE procedure directed personnel to declare the MDCT fan and associated reservoir inoperable per TS 3.7.2 due to nonfunctionality of the brake system only if a tornado watch or tornado warning had been issued for the area surrounding Fermi 2. This inadequate interpretation of TS was discovered during an NRC Component Design Basis Inspection (CDBI). At the time of discovery on August 25, 2016, all of the MDCT fan brakes were functional and the associated fans were operable. The fan brake system for each of the four trains is actuated by nitrogen which is supplied by three nitrogen stages (bottles [[GBM]]) arranged in series. The nitrogen source is the main bottle which supplies the other two bottles through pressure reducing valves [M]. Each of the three nitrogen bottles is rated at a different pressure and has procedurally specified lower and upper limits. The nitrogen pressures of all twelve bottles are recorded daily as part of operator rounds. If any of the nitrogen bottles is outside of its specified limits, the fan brake system is considered nonfunctional. The main nitrogen bottle for each train is replaced on an as-needed basis when it is out-of-specification or a trend indicates that it is approaching its lower limit. The replacement of a nitrogen bottle is performed per plant procedures. With a correct understanding of the applicable TS, a past operability review was performed for the three years prior to the date of discovery. This review identified multiple occurrences where the MDCT fan brakes were nonfunctional. General descriptions applicable to one or more of the occurrences are provided below and then followed by the details of the specific occurrences. For each occurrence, the associated MDCT fan and reservoir was considered operable at the time and no entry to TS 3.7.2 was made based on the fan brake nonfunctionality. ing Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.7.2 Condition B Required Action B.1 requires restoration of the reservoir within 72 hours. LCO 3.7.2 Condition D Required Actions D.1 and D.2 require the reactor to be in Mode 3 in 12 hours and Mode 4 in 36 hours if the Required Action and associated Completion Time of Condition B are not met.

3412016009|3|DESCRIPTION|1|INITIAL PLANT CONDITIONS Mode — 1 Reactor Power — 100 percent There were no structures, systems, or components (SSCs) that were inoperable at the start of this event that contributed to this event. DESCRIPTION At 1644 EDT on April 24, 2016, while operating in Mode 1 at 100 percent Reactor Thermal Power, Operators received alarm 9D8, Transformer [[XFMR]] 64 (SS64) Trouble. An initial investigation revealed that the Potential Transformer (PT) [[XPT]] for Buses [[BU]] 64A and 64C was not providing an output voltage signal to the relaying and instrumentation downstream of the PTs. Half of the loss of voltage (LOV) relays [[27]] and half of the degraded voltage relays (DVRs) for the 4.16 kiloVolt (kV) Emergency Bus 64C under voltage were tripped while the other half of both of those relays were not tripped. Therefore, the LOP instrumentation trip logic was in a half-tripped state. The LOV relays and DVRs together constitute the Technical Specification (TS) 3.3.8.1 Loss of Power (LOP) instrumentation to detect and respond to a loss of offsite power (LOOP) event. Licensed Operators initially incorrectly considered SS64 OPERABLE based on the proper voltage being maintained on Engineered Safety Feature (ESF) Buses 64B and 64C. Initially, the Division 1 Bus 64C LOP instrumentation was also incorrectly considered OPERABLE by Licensed Operators because the relays failed in their fail safe condition and the logic was capable of performing the safety function. The failure resulted in the LOP instrumentation going from a one out of two, taken twice, logic to a one out of two logic, which would have properly detected and responded to a loss of offsite power or degraded voltage event. At 1920 EDT on April 24, 2016, Operators restored the SS64 output voltage to above 121.3 meter Volts (V) by manual operation of the Load Tap Changer (LTC) [[TTC]] as required by System Operating Procedure 23.320, "Balance of Plant Auxiliary Electrical Distribution System" (Revision 63). Restoration of the voltage to 121.3 meter V ensured that adequate voltage was available to reset the LOV relays and DVRs during a LOCA coincident with a degraded grid. Division 2 offsite power and Combustion Turbine Generator (CTG) [[88]] 11-1 were OPERABLE at all times during the event. Although the equipment was initially determined to be OPERABLE, repairs were still required. Fermi 2 entered Mode 3 at 2301 EDT on May 3, 2016, and subsequently, entered Mode 4 at 1525 EDT on May 4, 2016, for Forced Outage (FO) 16-01 to trouble-shoot and repair the LOP instrumentation. Subsequent analysis of this event by Engineering determined that: A. Starting at 1644 on April 24, 2016, with the LTC automatic function disabled and voltage below 121.3 meter V, per Design Calculation (DC) 6447 Volume I, "Auxiliary Power System Analysis," (Revision C) the DVRs may not have reset upon a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) auto-start of ESF equipment in order to stay connected to the preferred offsite power source. Manual operation of the SS64 LTC by Operations boosted the output voltage of SS64 and ensured adequate voltage to reset the DVRs at 1920 on April 24, 2016.

3412016011|1|TITLE|1|Standby Liquid Control Inoperable due to Sodium Pentaborate Concentration Outside of Technical Specifications
3412016011|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   On October 28, 2016, at 1500 EDT, Fermi 2 Operators declared both subsystems of Standby Liquid Control (SLC) inoperable due to the sodium pentaborate concentration in the SLC storage tank being outside of the Technical Specification (TS) requirements. The sodium pentaborate concentration had been measured in response to the receipt of the SLC storage tank high level alarm. The demineralized water isolation valves that could cause a dilution of the tank were verified to be closed. Actions were initiated to add sodium pentaborate to the SLC storage tank to raise the concentration. SLC was declared operable at 1935 EDT following a measurement that verified that sodium pentaborate concentration had been restored to within the TS requirements. The cause of the event was determined to be leak-by of the demineralized water isolation valves that had caused an increase in SLC storage tank level and, therefore, a decrease in sodium pentaborate concentration. The leak-by had been occurring for some time and had gone undetected. The cause of the leak-by not being detected was determined to be inadequate system monitoring. 
3412016011|3|DESCRIPTION|1|INITIAL PLANT CONDITIONS Mode —1 Reactor Power — 100 percent There were no structures, systems, or components (SSCs) that were inoperable at the start of this event that contributed to this event. DESCRIPTION At 1051 EDT on October 28, 2016, while operating in MODE 1 at 100% power, the Fermi 2 Main Control Room (MCR) [[NA]] received an alarm for Standby Liquid Control (SLC) [[BR]] tank [[TK]] level. The MCR and local level indications [[LI]] both were above the high SLC storage tank level alarm [[LA]] setpoint. Operators verified SLC storage tank demineralized water isolation valves [[V]] were closed per the Alarm Response Procedure (ARP). The SLC storage tank was then manually measured to confirm level indication at 1214 EDT. The measured level was below the high SLC storage tank level alarm setpoint. A chemistry sample of the SLC storage tank to determine the sodium pentaborate concentration was requested. In order to ensure a representative sample of the SLC storage tank, sparging of the SLC storage tank was begun at 1340 EDT. In accordance with plant procedures, SLC is considered inoperable during the sparging process and, therefore, Technical Specification (TS) ing Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.1.7, "Standby Liquid Control (SLC) System," Condition B was entered for two SLC subsystems inoperable. Required Action B.1 to restore one SLC subsystem has a Completion Time of 8 hours. Sparging was completed at 1404 EDT (i.e. 24 minutes after entering LCO 3.1.7 Condition B) and the SLC system was declared OPERABLE. At 1500 EDT, the results of the chemistry sample of the SLC storage tank were obtained and indicated that the sodium pentaborate concentration was 8.3%. Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.1.7.5 requires the concentration to be within the limits of Figure 3.1.7-1. For the SLC storage tank level at the time of the event (i.e. near the high level alarm setpoint), the sodium pentaborate concentration was required to be in the range from 8.5% to 9.5% (weight percent). As a result, SLC was declared inoperable at 1500 EDT and LCO 3.1.7 Condition B was entered for two SLC subsystems inoperable. A second sample was taken and the results confirmed the previous value of 8.3%. Actions were initiated to add sodium pentaborate to the SLC storage tank to raise the concentration. Subsequent sparging and sampling determined that the sodium pentaborate concentration had been raised to 8.9%. Due to the sodium pentaborate concentration being restored to within the SR 3.1.7.5 requirements, SLC was declared OPERABLE at 1935 EDT (i.e. approximately 4.5 hours after entering LCO 3.1.7 Condition B) and the LCO was exited. The SLC storage tank level was then manually lowered to clear the level alarm per plant procedures. Local level indications and manual measurements confirmed the SLC storage tank level was below the high level alarm setpoint by 2216 EDT. A subsequent review of the event determined that the SLC storage tank level had been slowly increasing over several months due to introduction of water through one or both demineralized water isolation valves that were closed but leaking by. On October 9, a SLC pump and valve operability test was performed, in accordance with SR 3.1.7.7. Following the successful completion of this test, which involved cycling one of the demineralized water isolation valves, the valve leak-by increased as a more substantial increase in SLC storage tank level occurred. This increased leak-by was not detected by Operators until the occurrence of the high level alarm on October 28 as described above. Since the water leaking by the valves was demineralized, dilution of the sodium pentaborate concentration was occurring throughout this time. The frequency of TS SR 3.1.7.5 to determine the sodium pentaborate concentration is monthly. The most recent

3462016001|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   ' On January 29, 2016 at 1322 hours, with the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station operating at approximately 100 percent power, an automatic reactor trip occurred due to the actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS). Nuclear Instrumentation calibration for RPS Channel 2 was in progress. RPS Channel 2 was in bypass and Channel 1 was inoperable/tripped due to an existing Reactor Coolant System (RCS) temperature element (RTD) issue. A fuse failure in an input to RPS Channel 4 caused RPS Channel 4 trip on Flux/Delta-Flux/Flow, resulting in the reactor trip. Post trip, the Steam Feed water Rupture Control System (SFRCS) actuated due to high Steam Generator (SG) 1 level, initiating the Auxiliary Feed water (AFW) System. The cause of the SFRCS actuation was an improper response by the Integrated Control System (ICS) after the reactor trip. ICS Rapid Feed water Reduction. (RFR) circuit did not actuate and the ICS SG/Reactor Demand Hand/Auto Station transferred from automatic control to manual. 
3462016001|3|DESCRIPTION|1|Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX]. System Description: The Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station (DBNPS) Reactor Protection System (RPS) [JC] initiates a reactor trip to protect against violating the core fuel design limits and the Reactor Coolant System (RCS) [AB] pressure boundary during anticipated operational occurrences. The RPS consists of four separate redundant protection channels that receive inputs of neutron flux, RCS pressure, RCS flow, RCS temperature, Reactor Coolant Pump (RCP) [AB-P] status, and containment pressure. Each protection channel is composed of measurement channels and a reactor trip module. If an RPS instrumentation setpoint is exceeded, a channel trip signal is generated. The generation of any two trip signals in any of the four RPS channels will result in the trip of the reactor. The Steam and Feed water Line Rupture Control System (SFRCS) [JB] is required to ensure an adequate feed water supply to remove reactor decay heat during periods when the normal feed water supply has been lost. The SFRCS is designed to automatically start the Auxiliary Feed water System (AFW) [BA] in the event of a main steam line break, main feed water line rupture, a low level in the Steam Generators [AB-SG] or a loss of all four RCPs. The SFRCS is designed to automatically isolate the Main Steam System (MS) [SB] and Main Feed water System (MFW) [SJ] in the event of a main steam line break or main feed water line rupture. The AFW is automatically aligned to feed the unaffected steam generator upon a loss of steam pressure in one of the steam generators. Although not a safety function, the SFRCS also isolates MFW to the Steam Generators and initiates AFW to their respective Steam Generators in the event of high steam generator level. This is to prevent a steam generator overfill condition and subsequent spill over into the main steam lines and main turbine; which could cause thermal shock of steam generator internal structures, and could challenge the integrity of steam line piping and supports caused by excessive main feed water addition. This high steam generator level trip isolates the Main Steam Isolation Valves (MSIVs) [SB-ISV] to prevent damage to downstream plant equipment. The Integrated Control System (ICS) [JA] provides for coordination of the reactor, steam generator feed water control, and turbine under all operating conditions. This coordination consists of producing the best load response to the unit load demand while recognizing the capabilities and limitations of the reactor, steam generator feed water system, and turbine. When any single portion of the station is at an operating limit or a control section is on manual, the integrated control system uses the limited or manual section as a load reference. One of the features of the ICS Feed water Subsystem is a Rapid Feed water Reduction (RFR) scheme. The RFR scheme is designed to prevent refeeding the steam generators with feed water when not warranted, which could cause a primary system (RCS) overcooling transient. The RFR circuitry provides for a rapid decrease in feed water flow rate after a reactor trip and is also designed to preclude low steam generator level SFRCS actuations resulting from undershoot of the low level control limits. After a reactor trip, with all feed water stations in automatic, an RFR demand signal equivalent to approximately four (4) • percent of total feed water flow is substituted for valve position.

ABSTRACT (   ' On January 29, 2016 at 1322 hours, with the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station operating at approximately 100 percent power, an automatic reactor trip occurred due to the actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS). Nuclear Instrumentation calibration for RPS Channel 2 was in progress. RPS Channel 2 was in bypass and Channel 1 was inoperable/tripped due to an existing Reactor Coolant System (RCS) temperature element (RTD) issue. A fuse failure in an input to RPS Channel 4 caused RPS Channel 4 trip on Flux/Delta-Flux/Flow, resulting in the reactor trip. Post trip, the Steam Feed water Rupture Control System (SFRCS) actuated due to high Steam Generator (SG) 1 level, initiating the Auxiliary Feed water (AFW) System. The cause of the SFRCS actuation was an improper response by the Integrated Control System (ICS) after the reactor trip. ICS Rapid Feed water Reduction. (RFR) circuit did not actuate and the ICS SG/Reactor Demand Hand/Auto Station transferred from automatic control to manual.

3462016002|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   On January 30, 2016, with the plant in Mode 3, with the Auxiliary Feed water System (AFW) in operation and proceeding with Post Trip recovery actions from the January 29, 2016 Steam Feed water Rupture Control System (SFRCS) High Level Trip (reference Licensee Event Report (LER) 2016-001) when a SFRCS Steam Generator (SG) 1 High Reverse Differential Pressure (D/P) Trip was unexpectedly received. The trip was a result of a feed water isolation valve being opened to align the Motor Driven Feed Pump's (MDFP) discharge to SG 1. The unexpected SFRCS SG 1 Reverse D/P Trip resulted in the closure of the appropriate Main Steam and Main Feed water (MFW) valves, as designed. AFW Pumps 1 and 2 remained in operation, as expected and the plant was verified to be stable. The cause of this event was inadequate procedural guidance contained in the Trip Recovery Procedure with a 
3462016002|3|DESCRIPTION|1|Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX]. System Description: The Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station (DBNPS) Steam and Feed water Line Rupture Control System (SFRCS) [JB] is a protection system that initiates the Auxiliary Feed water System (AFW) [BA] and isolates the affected Steam Generator (SG) [AB-SG] on a steam or feed water line rupture. The SFRCS is required to ensure an adequate feed water supply to the steam generators to, remove reactor decay heat during periods when the normal feed water supply and/or the electric power supply to essential auxiliaries has been lost. The design of the SFRCS is to mitigate release of high energy steam, to automatically start the AFW System in the event of a main steam line or Main Feed water (MFW) line rupture, or on the loss of both main feed pumps [SJ-P] or the loss of all four Reactor Coolant Pumps (RCPs) [AB-P], and to prevent steam generator overfill and subsequent spillover into the main steam lines. The SFRCS also provides a trip signal to the Anticipatory Reactor Trip System (ARTS). In the event of a main steam line rupture, the SFRCS will close both Main Steam Isolation Valves (MSIVs) [SB-ISV] and all MFW control [SJ-LCV] and stop valves [SJ-ISV] and trip the main turbine [TA-TRB]. A loss of normal feed water is sensed by monitoring the differential pressure across the main feed water check valves. On a high reverse differential pressure, the SFRCS opens the steam supply from either steam generator to either auxiliary feed water pump turbine and aligns the auxiliary feed water pump to its associated steam generator. SFRCS also isolates MFW, main steam, and trips the reactor and the main turbine. On a reduced steam generator(s) inventory, the SFRCS responds similarly, with the exception that MFW and main steam will not be isolated. DESCRIPTION : On January 29, 2016, at 1322 hours, the DBNPS experienced a reactor trip and subsequent SFRCS actuation on SG 1 High Level. This resulted in various automatic actions, including the isolation of MFW to the SGs and starting both trains of AFW. The Plant was stable in Mode 3 with the AFW System providing AFW to the SGs, as designed. Refer to2016-001 for more information on the January 29, 2016 events. On January 30, 2016, with the plant remaining in Mode 3, Operations personnel were proceeding with Post Trip recovery actions using procedure DB-OP-06910, Trip Recovery, to transition from AFW to MFW supplying feed water to the SGs. The Motor Driven Feed water Pump (MDFP) was started and operated on minimum recirculation flow back to the Deaerator. The MDFP discharge flowpath was then aligned to the MFW system to refill and pressurize the downstream MFW header through the individual Minimum Bypass Throttle Valves (FW139, FW44) up to the closed MFW Isolation Valves (FW612, FW601). The MDFP continued to deliver feed water to the MFW header establishing a stable FW pressure upstream of the Minimum Bypass Throttle Valves (FW139, FW44). The MDFP flow remained steady at approximately 12-15 gallons per minute for approximately 5 minutes. In accordance with procedure DB-OP-06910, Operations personnel verified MFW pressure upstream of the Minimum Bypass Throttle Valves (FW139 and FW44) was greater than SG pressure. MFW to SG 2 Isolation Valve (FW601) was opened and in approximately 1 minute, MFW to SG 1 Isolation Valve (FW612) was opened. This resulted in a reverse delta pressure indication across the MFW check valve at 0123 hours as MFW to SG 1 Isolation Valve (FW612) was opened, resulting in an automatic actuation of the SFRCS
3462016002|4|CAUSE|1|The direct cause of the event was insufficient pressure in the piping upstream of the MFW to SG 1 Check valve (FW147), resulting in the SFRCS Actuation. When MFW to SG 1 Isolation Valve (FW612) was opening, the downstream SG pressure of approximately 870 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) was immediately applied to the downstream side of MFW to SG 1 Check Valve (FW147), developing greater than 125 pounds per square inch differential (psid) reverse DP, thus causing the SFRCS SG 1 High Reverse DP trip. The unexpected SFRCS SG 1 High Reverse D/P trip resulted in the reclosure of affected valves, including the MFW Isolation Valves, as designed. The AFW Pumps remained in operation, as expected. The MDFP remained operating aligned to the MFW Header and continued to pressurize the piping between the FW Heaters up to the MFW Isolation Valves. The apparent cause of the event is that less than adequate procedural guidance is contained in procedure DB-OP-06910, Trip Recovery. The guidance in this procedure was inadequate to ensure that the MFW piping segment between MFW Bypass Throttle Valve (FW139) and MFW to SG 1 Isolation Valve (FW612) was sufficiently pressurized prior to opening MFW to SG 1 Isolation Valve (FW612).. ANALYSIS The SFRCS is a protection system required to actuate AFW to the SG's to remove reactor decay heat during periods when normal feed water supply has been lost and/or upon loss of power to the RCP motors. Crossover piping exists that may be used to direct feed water from either AFW source to either SG. The SFRCS also functions to isolate steam and main feed water lines to mitigate overcooling events caused by steam depressurization: At the time of the event, the AFW System was operating and feeding the Steam Generators. The unit remained in Mode 3 and stable. This actuation did not have any negative impact to the AFW system and the ability to feed the steam generators. A bounding quantitative evaluation of risk impact was performed, using best available information, which estimated the delta Core Damage Frequency (CDF) to be 4.9E-07/yr. Based on this analysis, this event is considered to have a very low safety significance. Reportability Discussion: The Auxiliary Feed water System by the SFRCS on a valid reverse differential pressure is reportable within 8 hours of the event in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A). This notification was completed at 07:32 on January 30, 2016 (Event Number 51702). The receipt of an actuation signal of the Auxiliary Feed water System and the actuation/closure of several main steam system valves is reportable as a Licensee Event Report per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A). All safety systems performed as required in response to the event, and no loss of safety function occurred.

3462016003|1|TITLE|1|Leak from Reactor Coolant Pump Seal Piping Flexible Hose due to Undetected Manufacture Weld Defect
3462016003|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   On March 30, 2016, with the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station shutdown for a scheduled refueling outage in Mode 6 with the Reactor Coolant System depressurized, approximately one half teaspoon of dry boric acid was identified on the Reactor Coolant Pump (RCP) 1-1 first stage seal cavity vent line flexible braided piping connection, which was determined to be reactor coolant pressure boundary leakage. This leak was from the welded end connection of the small bore ASME Section III Class 2 flexible braided piping assembly between the RCP seal and the first isolation valve. The most probable cause of this leak was a weld solidification through-wall crack at the flange to hose / bellows tube pressure boundary weld that occurred during manufacture. The post manufacture testing was not adequate to detect this extremely small pressure boundary defect. 
3462016003|3|DESCRIPTION|1|Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX]. System Description: The Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station (DBNPS) Reactor Coolant System (RCS) [AB] uses four Reactor Coolant Pumps (RCPs) [AB-P] to circulate the reactor coolant. Each RCP is a single-stage centrifugal pump designed to produce a flow of approximately 90,000 gallons per minute (gpm) and driven at 1200 revolutions per minute by a 13,200 volt motor [AB-MO]. The RCPs are shaft-sealed with a seal cartridge assembly [AB-SEAL] that consists of three mechanical face-type sealing stages. The design flow rate for each seal staging flow coil is 1.5 gpm at a differential pressure of 750 pounds per square inch (psi). Approximately 8 to 10 gpm of seal injection water from the Makeup and Purification System [CB] is injected below the first stage mechanical seal for lubricating and cooling the seals. Most of the injection water passes into the pump case through the close-running, spiral grooved shaft and cover restriction bushing into the RCS, and the remainder (1.5 gpm) flows upward through the three mechanical seals. Flow from the three pressure break-down devices leaves the RCP through the seal return connection to return to the Makeup and Purification System. Leakage across the third seal face passes up the shaft and into a standpipe that drains to the containment normal sump. Technical Specification(s): Technical Specification (TS) ing Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.4.13 requires RCS operation leakage be limited to no Pressure Boundary leakage, 1 gpm unidentified leakage, 10 gpm identified leakage, and 150 gallons per day primary to secondary leakage through any one steam generator while the plant is in Modes 1 through 4. With operational leakage not within these limits for reasons other than pressure boundary leakage or primary to secondary leakage, TS LCO 3.4.13 Condition A requires the leakage to be reduced to within limits within 4 hours. If Condition A cannot be met within the required completion time, or if Pressure Boundary leakage exists, or primary to secondary leakage is not within limits, Condition B requires the plant be placed in Mode 3 in 6 hours and in Mode 5 in 36 hours. DESCRIPTION : On March 26, 2016, the DBNPS shutdown for scheduled refueling and maintenance activities. On March 30, 2016, with the station in Mode 6 and the RCS depressurized, a scheduled engineering inspection identified leakage from the RCP 1-1 seal injection flexible hose assembly and the leakage was determined to be an unisolable leak from the reactor coolant pressure boundary. This leakage was characterized as one half teaspoon of dry boric acid crystals, no active leak was identified and there was no indication of boric acid on the rest of the RCP seal package. The seal cavity vent lines for the first, second, and third stage seals are opened during RCS fill evolutions to vent non-condensable gases to the containment vent header. The leak was located on the RCP 1-1 first stage seal cavity vent line flexible hose assembly (at the flange to hose / bellows attachment), which is classified as small bore American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Section III Class 2 piping (3/4 inch pipe) between the RCP and the first isolation valve [AB-PSF] in the RCP vent piping.
3462016003|4|CAUSE|1|: A laboratory failure examination was unable to confirm the pressure boundary leak path, but a partial depth weld solidification crack was observed in the Alloy 625 pressure boundary material at the hose / bellows tube to socket end. A similar through-wall weld solidification crack at the flange to hose / bellows tube pressure boundary weld was likely the source for the boric acid leakage for the RCP 1-1 first stage seal cavity vent line. Therefore, the direct cause of the RCP 1-1, first stage seal cavity vent line pressure boundary leakage was likely a weld solidification crack during manufacture. Each of the other identified failure modes from operation, installation, manufacture, and design were refuted. The DBNPS had three (3) uninstalled spare flexible hose assemblies also supplied in the same batch as the leaking hose for the RCP 1-1 first stage seal cavity vent line. These spare hose assemblies were subsequently bubble tested (30 psig air pressure for 10 minutes) and helium tracer probe leak tested. All three (3) uninstalled spare flexible hose assemblies passed the bubble test, but one (1) failed the helium tracer probe leak test acceptance criteria. Helium tracer probe leak testing of the uninstalled spare hose assemblies permits increased sensitivity for detection of extremely small leaks. Helium tracer probe leak testing was proven an effective barrier that could have mitigated or prevented shipment of the flexible hose assembly with pressure boundary leakage. Therefore, the root cause of the pressure boundary leak path (weld solidification crack) not being detected during manufacture was less than adequate quality control inspection after manufacture of the flexible hose assemblies such that an extremely small pressure boundary defect was not detected by liquid penetrant and hydrostatic testing at 1.5 times design pressure (3750 psig) for 10 minutes. ANALYSIS : Because the RCP first stage seal cavity vent piping is classified, as ASME Section III Class 2 piping, in the event of a postulated failure, per design the reactor can be shut down and cooled down in an orderly manner assuming seal injection is maintained by the Makeup System. The estimated leak rate was well within the capability of the Makeup System's capability. Therefore this event was of very low safety significance. Reportability Discussion: Based on existing precedence, this leak was determined to be reportable per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(A) as degradation of a principal safety barrier; namely, the RCS, due to the material degradation (weld leak). The NRC was verbally notified of this event at 0014 hours on March 31, 2016, via Event Number 51837. This issue is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A) as degradation of a principal safety barrier. Additionally, as this is RCS Pressure Boundary leakage and it potentially could have existed with the plant in operation, contrary to TS LCO 3.4.13, which does not allow any Pressure Boundary leakage, this issue is also being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as operation or condition prohibited by Technical Specifications. No safety functions were lost as a result of this issue and all TS required actions

3462016004|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   On April 5, 2016, at 0243, with the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station (DBNPS) in Mode 5, it was discovered that the six dual-element Resistance Temperature Detectors .(RTD) on both Reactor Coolant SyStem (RCS) Hot Legs had varying degrees of wire insulation degradation. The cause of the RTD insulation degradation was accelerated aging due to high temperatures as a result of improper configuration of piping insulation on the RTD during the previous refueling outage. 
3462016004|3|DESCRIPTION|1|Energy Industry Identification System (El IS) codes are identified in the text as [XX]. System Description: At the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station (DBNPS), the Reactor Coolant (RCS) [AB] System has three thermowells on each of the two RC System Hot Legs/Loops, and each thermowell houses one dual-element Resistance Temperature Detector (RTD) [TI]. Of the twelve RTDs, four provide an input to the Reactor Protection System (RPS) [JC], four provide an input to the Post Accident Monitoring (PAM) [IP] System, and the remaining four provide an input to the Non-Nuclear Instrumentation (NNI) [EE]. The RPS initiates a reactor trip to protect against violating the core fuel design limits and the RCS pressure boundary during anticipated operational occurrences. The protection and monitoring systems have been designed to assure safe operation of the reactor. This is achieved by specifying limiting safety system settings in terms of parameters directly monitored by the RPS, as well as the Technical Specification (TS) ing Conditions (LCO) for Operation on other reactor system parameters and equipment performance. The PAM instrumentation displays unit variables that provide information required by the control room operators during accident situations. This information provides the necessary support for the operator to take the manual actions for which no automatic control is provided and that are required for safety systems to accomplish their safety functions for Design Basis Events. The NNI provides the required input signals of process variables for the reactor protection, regulating and auxiliary systems. It performs the required process control functions in response to those systems and provides instrumentation for startup, operation, and shutdown of the reactor system under normal and emergency conditions. The NNI performs no TS required functions. The Remote Shutdown System monitoring instrumentation provides the control room operator with sufficient instrumentation to support maintaining the unit in a safe shutdown condition from locations other than the control room. This capability is necessary to protect against the possibility that the control room becomes inaccessible. Technical Specifications: TS LCO 3.3.1 requires four channels of RPS high Reactor Coolant temperature instrumentation be Operable in Modes 1 and 2. Four of the affected RTD elements (one per channel) provide input to the RPS. Each RTD element supports two RPS functions: Reactor Coolant High Temperature and Reactor Coolant Pressure-Temperature. With one RPS channel inoperable, Condition A requires the channel be placed in bypass or trip within one hour. With two channels inoperable, Condition B requires one channel be placed in trip and the second channel be placed in bypass within one hour. If the Required Action and associated Completion Time of Condition A or B are not met while in Mode 1, Conditions C and D require the unit be in Mode 3 within 6 hours along with the Control Rod Drive (CRD) trip breakers being opened for the applicable RPS functions. Page 2 of 7
3462016004|4|CAUSE|1|: While analyzing the cause, it was identified that two Engineering Change Packages (ECPs) were developed and implemented to replace the six dual-element RTDs during the Steam Generator Replacement Project (SGRP) in 2014. One ECP was written to support piping insulation removal and re-installation with a new, more effective insulation; and the second ECP was written to support RTD replacement. During comment resolution of the RTD ECP, the EQ Engineer provided comments and statements pertaining to insulation requirements that were not fully addressed and were not ultimately passed on to the engineer responsible for the piping insulation ECP. Additional individual errors were made during ECP development and work order along with post-implementation walkdown. Basic work practice weaknesses resulted in incorrect design development and implementation of the piping insulation for the RTD thermowells. The direct cause of the RTD conductor wiring insulation degradation was accelerated aging due to high temperatures located at the RTD termination head. This wiring degradation was as a result of improper configuration of piping insulation on the RTD extension stem during the previous outage. The apparent cause of the incorrect piping insulation configuration was due to incorrect and insufficient guidance provided in the piping insulation Engineering Change Package. The cause of the backward installation of the Midlock Ferrules on RTDs TERC3B5 and TERC3A4 is that less than adequate instructions were available to support the successful assembly and installation of the Conax ECSAs. ANALYSIS : The wire insulation degradation on the RC Hot Leg RTD, TERC3B2, resulted in the output temperature indication to deviate in the downward direction and thus it was unable to perform its intended function of providing Channel 1 input to the RPS for a High Temperature Trip or a Pressure/Temperature Trip. The RPS High Temperature Trip provides backup protection for RCS overheating events and is not used as the primary trip function for any accident analysis. The RCS Pressure/Temperature Trip is the primary trip for only a RCS letdown line rupture accident. Since the RPS trips associated with these instruments are high temperature trips and the failure mechanism caused by the insulation damage is a failed low condition, the insulation damage would not have resulted in a plant trip or transient, arid therefore would not cause an initiating event, nor the reactor trips associated with those instruments, for mitigating any accidents or transients.

3462016005|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   On May 10, 2016, the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station (DBNPS) was in Mode 1 and increasing power following refueling outage activities. At 0528 hours, it was identified that all four of the Anticipatory Reactor Trip System (ARTS) \ channel switches were in the bypass position for the Main Turbine function while at approximately 53 percent power. These switches are required by the Technical Specifications to be in the normal/enabled position when above 45 percent power. The switches were restored to Normal and the applicable Technical Specifications exited at 0552 hours. An Operations Standing Order was issued to require paired periodic walk downs of all Control Room panels to ensure a comprehensive understanding of plant status awareness. Walk downs were also performed to independently identify any additional concerns or omissions in plant startup activities. The root cause of this event is the operators failed to effectively work as a team to ensure a safety system was in an operable condition when required. 
3462016005|3|DESCRIPTION|1|Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX]. System Description: At the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station (DBNPS), 'the purpose of the Anticipatory Reactor Trip System (ARTS) is to initiate .a reactor trip on a loss of main feed water [SI] event or a trip of the Main Turbine [TA] at power in order to reduce the magnitude of pressure and temperature transients on the Reactor Coolant , System [AB]. This lowers the probability of the Pressurizer Pilot Operated Relief Valve (PORV) [AB-RV] actuation during these events. The ARTS was added to the Babcock and Wilcox (B) designed plants following the Three Mile Island Unit 2 accident, but is not credited to mitigate the consequence of any accident in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). The ARTS consists of four separate redundant protection channels that receive inputs of Main Feed water (MFW) pump [SI-P] status and Main Turbine status.. Each protection channel contains a logic trip module, which transmits trip signals to its own two-out-of-four logic and to the two-out-of-four logic of the 'logic trip modules in the other three ARTS protective channels. Whenever any two ARTS channels transmit channel trip signals, the logic trip module in each channel actuates to remove power from its associated Control Rod Drive trip breaker [AA-BKR]. Technical Specifications: Technical Specification (TS) ing Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.3.16 requires three channels of the ARTS instrumentation Turbine Trip function be Operable when greater than 45 percent Rated Thermal Power. With one required channel inoperable, Condition A requires the channel be restored to Operable status within 72 hours. If the Required Action and associated. Completion Time is not met, Condition B requires reactor thermal power to be reduced to less than 45 percent power within 6 hours. TS LCO 3.3.16 also requires three channels of the Trip of Both Main Feed Pump Turbines instrumentation function and four channels of the Output Logic function be operable when in Mode 1. DESCRIPTION : On May 9, 2016, the unit entered Mode 1 at 1524 hours following refueling outage activities. One of the projects completed during the outage was replacement of the Control Rod Drive System with a digital system per Engineering Change Package (ECP) 12-0272. On May 10, 2016, with the unit at approximately 53 percent power, it was identified during review of Control Room Annunciators at 0528 hours that the ARTS test trip bypass annunciator was lit. The status of the ARTS Trip Bypass switches was reviewed and it was identified that all four ARTS channels were in Steam Feed Rupture Control System (SFRCS) [JB] bypass and Main Turbine bypass vice the expected "Normal" 2 condition. Page 2 of 5
3462016005|4|CAUSE|1|: Operating Procedure DB-OP-06902, Power Operations, provides operating instructions for Main Turbine startup at 18 percent power through full power operation as well as reactor shutdown. Step 4.6.5 of DB-OP-06902 instructs the operator to verify ARTS is enabled prior to reaching 45 percent power. The direct cause for the ARTS Trip Bypass being left in bypass for SFRCS and Main Turbine during startup is the reactor operator failed to fully read and understand procedure DB-OP-06902 step 4.6.5 prior to verifying ARTS enabled at approximately 40 percent power. The operator did not preview/review the task/procedure before performance. The root cause of this event is the operators failed to effectively work as a team to ensure a safety system was in an operable condition prior to the mode of applicability for plant startup. The operators were ineffective in their advocacy to understand why ARTS was in bypass and failed to get a critical review of assumptions they made that plant startup procedures would, at some point, restore ARTS. A contributing cause to this event is some procedures were not developed in accordance with approved processes and did not contain specific guidance for restoration of ARTS after all 'four channels of all parameters were placed in bypass. This was evident in temporary Test Procedure DB-TP-10405, Digital Control Rod Drive System (DCRDCS) Post Installation Testing for ECP 12-0272 as well as other operating procedures. ANALYSIS : With the ARTS channels in bypass, the anticipatory reactor trip signal on a Main Turbine Trip would not have been provided. The reactor trip output function of SFRCS, since it uses the ARTS trip as its means of tripping the reactor, would likewise have been disabled. All of the other features of the SFRCS (e.g., start Auxiliary Feed water Pumps [AB-P], align valves to isolate and/or feed water to the, Steam Generators [AB-SG]) would still have functioned. As stated above, the ARTS, including the SFRCS reactor trip function to ARTS, is 'not credited to mitigate the consequences of any UFSAR accident. The Davis-Besse Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) model does not model ARTS or credit it for tripping the reactor or mitigating any accidents or transients. All of the SFRCS functions which are modeled in the PRA were still available (e.g., start Auxiliary Feed water Pumps, align valves to isolate and/or feed water to the Steam Generators). Other protective systems such as the Reactor Protection System [JC] and the Safety Features Actuation System [JE] were functional, and the Immediate Action for an SFRCS trip indication is for the Control Room Operators to manually trip the reactor. The switch mispositioning occurred while the plant was at a reduced power level of 53 percent and with minimal decay heat in the core, as it occurred during startup from a refueling outage. The plant was in this condition for approximately 54 minutes. Therefore, the bypass of the ARTS channels while above 45 percent reactor power is qualitatively evaluated as having very low safety significance. Page 3 of 5

3462016006|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   On June 16, 2016, the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station (DBNPS) was in Mode 1'and 100 percent reactor power. At 1137 hours, during review of industry operating experience, an issue was identified for the potential impact of low barometric pressure associated with a tornado on the Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs). The EDGs are equipped with a crankcase positive pressure trip with a set point of approximately 1 inch of water. It was determined that a design basis tornado could create sufficient low pressure to potentially actuate the crankcase positive pressure trip due to different vent paths between the EDG Room and the EDG crankcase. If the crankcase pressure trip occurs before the EDG starts on an emergency signal due to the tornado, the crankcase pressure trip would cause an EDG lockout. The EDG lockout would then prevent either an EDG normal or emergency start until operators could manually reset the lockout. This condition could potentially affect both EDGs simultaneously. This was an original EDG protective logic circuitry design issue that did not anticipate the interaction between the crankcase pressure trip and the outside atmospheric pressure. 
3462016006|3|DESCRIPTION|1|Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX]. DESCRIPTION OCCURRENCE: System Description: The on-site electric power system [EB] standby power at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station (DBNPS) is provided by two separate and redundant Emergency Diesel Generators (EDG) [EK-DG] each connected to its respective 4160 Volt Essential Bus [EB-BU]. Each EDG is designed to start and reach stabilized voltage and frequency within ten seconds after receiving the starting signal. Upon receiving an emergency start signal from Safety Feature Actuation Signal (SFAS) [JE] or on a loss of essential bus voltage, the EDG is automatically isolated and loaded according to a predetermined sequence. All safety loads are assumed to be loaded within 35 seconds including the 10-second starting interval. Each diesel engine is a General Motors, Bruce, 2-cycle, 20-cylinder, turbocharged diesel. Each engine drives a generator, which is nominally rated for 2600 kilowatts continuous electric service. Each EDG is equipped with mechanical and electrical interlocks to ensure personnel protection and to prevent or limit equipment damage. During a non-emergency diesel generator operation (for example, on-line testing) each of the EDGs is provided with mechanical and electrical protective devices capable of initiating an EDG trip. However, during an emergency operation, namely on a loss of essential bus voltage or an SFAS Level 2, controls limit the EDG trip to generator differential relay action and engine overspeed. This measure is taken to minimize the possibility of the protective devices needlessly preventing the EDG from operating when required, as during a Design Basis Accident. However, alarms are still provided for high crankcase pressure, low lube oil pressure, high engine temperature, and electrical protective relays. Mechanical protection is provided for the EDG engine by monitoring crankcase pressure to protect the engine from damage. If crankcase pressure increases above the setpoint of 1 inch of water gauge (WG) (with a range of 0.8 to 3 inches WG), the engine will trip and a local alarm will be actuated. The trip function is bypassed by an EDG emergency start signal. The EDG High Crankcase Pressure Switches [PS] are pressure-sensitive devices used to determine abnormal condition of the crankcase. A negative pressure is normally maintained in the crankcase with the engine running. When the EDG is in standby, the crankcase directly communicates with the EDG exhaust and the crankcase pressure would be similar to atmospheric pressure outside of the EDG Rooms in the Auxiliary Building. Therefore, if the pressure of the EDG rooms would be 0.8 inches WG less than the pressure in the crankcase, the EDG High Crankcase Pressure Switches could trip. Each EDG is provided with storage tanks having a fuel oil capacity sufficient to operate that diesel for a period of 7 days following a Loss of Offsite Power. This onsite fuel oil capacity is based on the fact that 7 days is sufficient time to replenish the onsite tank inventory from outside sources. Additionally, one non-class 1 E diesel generator can be aligned to power either 4160 Volt essential bus in the event of a station blackout. Page 2 of 5

ABSTRACT (   On June 16, 2016, the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station (DBNPS) was in Mode 1'and 100 percent reactor power. At 1137 hours, during review of industry operating experience, an issue was identified for the potential impact of low barometric pressure associated with a tornado on the Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs). The EDGs are equipped with a crankcase positive pressure trip with a set point of approximately 1 inch of water. It was determined that a design basis tornado could create sufficient low pressure to potentially actuate the crankcase positive pressure trip due to different vent paths between the EDG Room and the EDG crankcase. If the crankcase pressure trip occurs before the EDG starts on an emergency signal due to the tornado, the crankcase pressure trip would cause an EDG lockout. The EDG lockout would then prevent either an EDG normal or emergency start until operators could manually reset the lockout. This condition could potentially affect both EDGs simultaneously. This was an original EDG protective logic circuitry design issue that did not anticipate the interaction between the crankcase pressure trip and the outside atmospheric pressure.

DESCRIPTION OCCURRENCE: System Description: The Reactor Coolant System (RCS) [AB] at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station (DBNPS) has two identical Pressurizer Safety Valves (PSV) [AB-RV], each located on a flanged nozzle on the Pressurizer [AB-PZR] top head. The PSVs (valve/equipment numbers RC13A and RC13B) were manufactured by Crosby Valve & Gage Company, Model Number HB-86-BP Type E series valves designed for nuclear service and certified under Section III of the American Society of Mechanical Engineering (ASME) code for application in nuclear power systems. The valves are designed to be self-actuating, spring loaded, with balancing bellows and a balancing piston. The functidn of the PSVs is to ensure the RCS pressure does not exceed the Technical Specification (TS) 2.1.2 Safety  of 2750 pounds per square inch gauge (psig). Technical Specifications: Technical Specification (TS) 3.4.10, "Pressurizer Safety Valves", ing Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.4.10 requires two PSVs be OPERABLE with lift settings less than or equal to 2525 psig in Modes 1, 2 and 3. With one PSV inoperable, TS 3.4.10 Action A requires the valve be restored to operable status within 15 minutes. If this required action cannot be met, or if two PSVs are inoperable, TS 3.4.10 Action B requires the plant to be placed in Mode 3 within 6 hours and in Mode 4 within 12 hours. DESCRIPTION : On March 26, 2016, the DBNPS shut down for Nineteenth Refueling Outage activities. As part of this outage, the two installed PSVs were removed and replaced with acceptable pre-tested spare valves under the preventive maintenance program. The removed PSVs, which had been previously installed in Spring of 2014 during the Eighteenth Refueling Outage, were sent to an offsite vendor for testing and refurbishment. On June 21, 2016, with the plant operating in Mode 1 at 100 percent power, following receipt of final test results from the vendor test facility, it was identified that both valves had As-Found lift settings above the limits specified in TS 3.4.10. Because both valves had As-Found setpoints above the TS allowed value (2559 psig for RC13A and 2554 psig for RC13B), a past operability evaluation was performed. The past operability evaluation determined these valves were inoperable while they were installed in the plant during the past operational cycle.: The direct cause of the as-found test setpoint of the PSVs to be greater than the TS allowable value of less than or equal to 2525 psig was determined to be setpoint drift. This is the same cause identified for a similar failure at the DBNPS in 2011 (reference Previous Similar Events Section below). Setpoint drift cannot be eliminated; however, as described in the

At 2342 hours a power supply in SFAS Channel 2 failed and a separate TS LCO 3.3.5 Condition A was entered. Upon recognition that two channels of SFAS were inoperable, TS LCO 3.3.5 Condition B was entered at 0245 and then exited at 0330 with the use of compensatory actions to restore SFAS Channel 1 operability. After further review, it was determined the compensatory actions could not be credited and TS LCO 3.3.5, Condition B was re-entered at 1325. SFAS Channel 1 was restored and declared operable at 1351 hours. Causes of the event were the Shift Manager failed to initially recognize that TS LCO Conditions A and B had been met; followed by Station Personnel failing to effectively implement required processes. The root cause was that Station Management failed to recognize that a normalized deviation had occurred that resulted in TS noncompliance. s include specific refresher training to all applicable personnel, revising relevant documents, and developing an event Case Study for training purposes.

3462016008|3|DESCRIPTION|1|Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX]. DESCRIPTION OCCURRENCE: System Description: The Safety Features Actuation System (SFAS) [JE] at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station (DBNPS) is designed to automatically prevent or limit fission product and energy release from the core, to isolate the containment vessel and to initiate the operation of Engineered Safety Features equipment in the event of a loss of coolant accident and main steam line break. The SFAS operates in a distributed manner to initiate the appropriate systems. The SFAS does this by determining the need for actuation in each of four channels monitoring each actuation parameter. Once the need for actuation is determined, the condition is transmitted to automatic actuation logics, which perform the two-out-of-four logic to determine the actuation of each end device. Four plant parameters are used for automatic SFAS actuation. The fifth parameter, the Borated Water Storage Tank (BWST) [BP-T] Level — Low Low, is used to provide a permissive to allow manual transfer from the BWST to the containment emergency sump. The SFAS consists of four identical redundant instrument (sensing) and logic channels and two identical redundant actuation channels, and each instrument channel includes trip bistable modules with digital isolation devices. The isolated output of the trip bistable module is used to comprise coincidence matrices with the terminating relays within the actuation channel of the SFAS. The trip bistables monitor the station variables and normally feed continuous electrical (fail-safe) signals into two-out-of-four coincidence matrices. Should any of the station variables exceed their trip setpoints, the corresponding bistables in each of the four channels will trip and cease sending output signals. If two of the four channel bistables monitoring the same station variable cease to send output signals, the corresponding normally-energized terminating relays on all channels will trip. The SFAS is a fail-safe, de-energize to trip, system. Therefore, if the power supply to a channel is lost, that channel will trip, reducing the system coincidence matrices from two-out-of-four to one-out-of-three mode. The terminating relays of sensing and logic channels 1 and 3 must both be de-energized to activate safety actuation channel 1. Similarly, sensing and logic channels 2 and 4 must both be de-energized to activate safety actuation channel 2. The terminating relays (also known as output relays) [JE-RLY] act on the actuation control devices such as motor controllers and solenoid valves. The BWST supplies borated water for emergency core cooling via the Decay Heat Removal/Low Pressure Injection (LPI) System [BP] and High Pressure Injection (HPI) System [BJ], and as a source of borated water for the Containment Spray System [BE]. During accident conditions, the BWST provides containment cooling and depressurization, core cooling, and replacement inventory and is a source of negative reactivity for reactor shutdown. The BWST ensures that an adequate supply of borated water is available to cool and depressurize the containment in the event of a Design Bases Accident (DBA); to cool and cover the core in the event of a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA.), and to ensure an adequate level exists in the containment sump to support ECCS and containment spray pump operation in the recirculation mode. The BWST level is monitored by four independent level transmitters. Each of the differential pressure signals generated by these transmitters is monitored by a bistable to provide a trip signal at a low low level. The BWST allowable value of greater than or equal to 101.6 inches of water and less than or equal to 115.4
3462016008|4|CAUSE|1|The direct cause for the failure to properly apply TS 3.3.5 was determined to be that the Shift Manager failed to initially recognize that entry conditions for TS LCO 3.3.5 Condition B had been met following a loss of power to SFAS Channel 2. The TS was not reviewed in its entirety and provided peer checks were not performed independently. A contributing cause of the improper application of TS 3.3.5 was determined to be that station personnel failed to use or rigorously implement required processes and procedures involving the conduct of operations, event reporting, operability determination, and regulatory communications and interface. The root cause for the failure to properly apply TS 3.3.5 was determined to be that station management failed to recognize in a timely manner that a normalized deviation in organizational behaviors has occurred surrounding the accountability for.critical performance standards and expectations. Additionally, organizational biases such as maintaining an unrealistic optimism towards an outcome, technical arrogance, overconfidence in knowledge and expertise, and the failure to seek or respond effectively to challenges, have resulted in the tendency to rationalize behaviors. ANALYSIS The BWST Level Transmitters monitor the BWST Level and initiate an SFAS Level 5 signal on BWST Level -Low Low. This output signal provides a passive permissive interlock to allow operators the ability to shift ECCS suction from the BWST to the Emergency Sump by allowing operators to Open the Decay Heat Pump Suction From Emergency Sump Valves and close the associated BWST Isolation Valves. The transfer of suction source from the BWST to the Emergency Sump is a manual transfer. The Probabilistic Risk Analysis (PRA) models failure of the SFAS. Level 5 permissive signal, as well as failure of the valves to be repositioned (or failure of the human action to manually transfer the suction), which could result in the inability of the plant to shift ECCS suction from the BWST to the Emergency Sump. The four-channel SFAS system is a 2-out-of-four circuit, such that any two level instruments which sense a BWST Level — Low Low will actuate the permissive interlock for both trains. With both LT1525A and LT1525B out of service, the SFAS BWST Level — Low Low passive permissive transfer was active (i.e., the valves could be repositioned to shift from the BWST to the Emergency Sump) as indicated by Annunciator 5-3-A, BWST LO-LO LVL XFEREMER SUMP. Since the permissive interlock was met, a failure of this SFAS Level 5 permissive signal is not possible. Having the transfer permissive interlock active while the BWST was still full could permit operators to inadvertently transfer suction from the BWST to the Emergency Sump (violating procedure guidance) before there was adequate volume in the Emergency Sump. Additionally, having the transfer permissive annunciator 5-3-A lit significantly prior to reaching the BWST Level procedurally directing the transfer to the

3462016009|2|ABSTRACT|1|(   On September 10, 2016, with the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station (DBNPS) operating at approximately 100 percent power, rainwater intrusion into the Main Generator Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) cabinet due to an open roof vent caused a lockout of the Main Generator, resulting in a trip of the Main Turbine and Reactor. Following the Reactor trip, the Steam Feed water Rupture Control System (SFRCS) actuated due to high Steam Generator 1 level and initiated the Auxiliary Feed water System. The most probable cause of the SFRCS actuation was a failed operational amplifier in the Integrated Control System (ICS), causing the ICS to not reduce Feed water flow to Steam Generator 1 following the Reactor trip. , Completed 
3462016009|3|DESCRIPTION|1|Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX]. System Description: The Main Generator [TB] converts rotating mechanical energy of the Main Turbine [TA] into electrical energy. The excitation system provides regulated Direct Current (DC) power to the Main Generator field/rotor for controlling the voltage and reactive volt-ampere output, with an Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) controlling the electrical current to the Main Generator field. The AVR was installed at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station (DBNPS) in 2014 as a digital upgrade from the previous analog voltage regulator. The Integrated Control System (ICS) [JA] provides for coordination of the Reactor, Steam Generator Feed water control, and Main Turbine under all operating conditions. This coordination consists of producing the best load response to the unit load demand while recognizing the capabilities and limitations of the controlled equipment. When any single portion of the station is at an operating limit or a control section is on manual, the ICS uses the limited or manual section as a load reference. One of the features of the ICS Feed water Subsystem is a Rapid Feed water Reduction (RFR) scheme, which is designed to prevent refeeding the Steam Generators with Feed water when not warranted to prevent a primary system (Reactor Coolant System) overcooling transient. The RFR circuitry provides for a rapid decrease in Feed water flow rate after a Reactor trip and is also designed to preclude low Steam Generator level actuations of the Steam and Feed water Rupture Control System (SFRCS) resulting from undershoot of the low level control limits. After a Reactor trip, with all Feed water stations in automatic, an RFR demand signal equivalent to approximately four (4) percent of total Feed water flow is substituted for Feed water Control valve position. The SFRCS [JB] is required to ensure an adequate Feed water supply to remove Reactor decay heat during periods when the normal Feed water supply has been lost. The SFRCS is designed to automatically start the Auxiliary Feed water System (AFW) [BA] in the event of a Main Steam line break, Main Feed water line rupture, a low level in the Steam Generators [AB-SG] or a loss of all four Reactor Coolant Pumps. The SFRCS is designed to automatically isolate the Main Steam System (MS) [SB] and the Main Feed water System (MFW) [SJ] in the event of a Main Steam line break or Main Feed water line rupture. The AFW is automatically aligned to feed the unaffected Steam Generator upon a loss of steam pressure in one of the Steam Generators. Although not a safety function, the SFRCS also isolates MFW to the Steam Generators and initiates AFW to their respective Steam Generators in the event of high Steam Generator level. This is to prevent a Steam Generator overfill condition and subsequent spill over into the Main Steam lines and Main Turbine; which could cause thermal shock of Steam Generator internal structures, and could challenge the integrity of steam line piping and supports caused by excessive Main Feed water addition. This high Steam Generator level trip isolates the Main Steam Isolation Valves (MSIVs) [SB-ISV] to prevent damage to downstream plant equipment. DESCRIPTION : On September 9, 2016, the DBNPS was operating in Mode 1 at approximately 100 percent power. Rain had been forecasted in the evening, and operators were dispatched to close the Turbine Building [NM] roof vents, which were routinely opened to help limit ambient temperatures within the building. Four of the 14 roof vents could not be closed due to known and documented material deficiencies.
3462016009|4|CAUSE|1|: The direct cause of the generator lockout and subsequent reactor trip was rain falling through an open roof vent onto the Turbine deck, which migrated into the AVR through one or more of the cabinet's conduit connections. The root causes of the generator lockout and reactor trip were (1) Operations Shift Managers did not advocate adequate and timely compensatory actions to eliminate the risk to generation posed by rain falling onto energized equipment through a stuck open Turbine Building roof vent, and (2) station management failed to recognize the roof vent rain issue as a potential imminent risk to generation. There are fourteen 4-foot by 8-foot smoke and heat vents in the Turbine Building roof, which are designed to automatically open at 165 degrees F due to a fusible link. Manual pull release handles also allow each vent to be opened without disturbing the fusible link. The roof vents had been routinely opened during warm weather to compensate for deficiencies in-the Turbine Building ventilation in order to reduce Turbine Building ambient temperatures. On August 14, 2016, it was identified that four of the roof vents could not be closed, including roof vent number 8 above the AVR. On the evening of August 17, 2016, operators noted water running from the Turbine deck (623 foot elevation) to the floor below (603 foot elevation) following a heavy rain storm due to roof vent 8.  being open. Maintenance personnel inspected the roof vents the following day to identify the necessary repairs, but no accelerated actions were taken beyond the normal work management process to repair the vents. Catch basins were installed below roof vent 8 on August 27, 2016, in attempt to collect the rain water to prevent it from affecting the equipment below. 1.
