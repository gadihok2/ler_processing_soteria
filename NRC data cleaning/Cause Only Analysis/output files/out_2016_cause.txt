2472016001|1|CAUSE|1|The apparent cause for the failure was internal friction due to spindle rod wear, which causes the spindle rod to bind against internal components. High vibrations of the spindle rod caused friction between the rod, spring washer, and adjusting bolt. The vibration of the spindle rod while in contact with the spring washer and adjusting bolt resulted in severe wear in the form of steps on the spindle rod. The resulting frictional force occurs on the first lift and then does not repeat. The vendor's solution to the problem is to install sacrificial bronze wear sleeves along the inner diameter of the spindle rod contact points (inner diameters of the adjusting bolt, upper spring washer, and lower spring washer). The spring washers and adjusting bolt are machined to accept the bronze wear sleeves, which act as a sacrificial metal, preventing spindle wear and step formation. One-sleeve is installed in each of the spring washers and two sleeves are installed in the adjusting bolt. An extent of condition (EOC) was performed to determine where potential conditions with similar valves, design, systems, and environments could occur. The review determined that the EOC found in the failure of MS-45B is restricted to the other 19 MSSVs at Unit 2 and the 20 MSSVs at Unit 3 due to the excluive valve design. All MSSVs are exposed to high vibrations during their operating cycle during which wear can occur. Previous failures of MSSVs have included wear due to spring skewing and -setpoint drift.' Spring skewing can occur in any of the MSSVs and cause side loading frictional forces which prevent the valve from lifting. Setpoint drift can occur due to age of the components and the operating cycle it is exposed to (e.g., changes in temperature, pressure and vibrations). PAST SIMILAR S A-review was performed of LicenseeEVent Reports (LERs) for any events reporting TS prohibited conditions due to MSSV test failures.2010-002 reported two MSSV failures, one due to valve spring skew and the other due to setpoint drift. 2012-005 reported one MSSV outside the required as-found lift setpoint range due to spring skew/spindle wear. The MSSVs at Unit 2 are the same as those at Unit 3, and LERs have reported MSSV test failures at Unit 3. LER-2011-004 reported two MSSVs outside the required as-found lift setpoint ranges due to spindle wear and spring skew. LER-2013-001 reported two MSSVs outside the required as-found lift setpoint ranges due to galling around the circumference of the spindle rod as a result of vibration for one valve, and internal friction caused by foreign material between the guide bearing and spindle for the other valve.2015-002 reported three MSSVs outside the required as-found lift setpoint ranges due to internal friction from spindle rod vibration.
2472016002|1|CAUSE|1|The direct cause of the event that occurred on March 7, 2016 at approximately 10:18 hours was a loss of power to 480 Volt Bus 3A when the normal supply breaker from Station Service Transformer (SST-3) tripped on overcurrent due to excessive loads energized on Bus 3A and Bus 6A. As designed, this caused the 480 Volt AC buses to strip loads, resulting in the loss of both 21 and 22 RHR Pumps, 21 SFP Pump, lighting and various other loads. The apparent cause was inadequate guidance in 2-PT-R084C resulting in excessive loads energized on Buses 3A and 6A. Procedure 2-PT-R084C contained a precaution and limitation to limit current on the 3AT6A cross tie breaker but contained no guidelines on limiting current on the Bus 3A normal supply breaker (i.e. breaker overcurrent trip point was listed but this was for information only and there are no meters where this current can be read). At the time, SST-3 was carrying approximately 260 amps. Procedure 2-PT-R084C was subsequently revised to include a precaution and limitation to maintain SST loads less than 200 amps. The direct cause for the second transient that occurred on March 7, 2016 at approximately 11:32 hours was determined to be cracked solder connections on the 23 EDG AVR circuit card. Following a microscopic inspection of the solder joints for the magnetic amplifier by the vendor, it was determined that all nine terminals for the Ll magnetic amplifier exhibited solder cracking. Based upon the cyclic heating and cooling of the Ll magnetic amplifier, it was concluded that thermal growth of the Ll magnetic amplifier relative to the card could have caused cyclic stress on the solder joints. TherefOre, thermally-induced stress is the most likely cause of the solder joint cracks. The apparent cause was the failure to establish a PM strategy in accordance with a Part 21 notification and vendor's maintenance bulletin for the AVR card defect. Based on the intermittent nature of this failure in addition to elimination of all remaining potential causes, it is with high confidence that the cause for the overcurrent trip event which occurred on March 7, 2016 was the result of the intermittent symptoms associated with the degraded connections on the AVR assembly. This condition was recorded in the Indian Point Energy Center

ABSTRACT (  ) On March 7, 2016, during a refueling outage the control switch for the 21 Main Boiler Feed water Pump (MBFP) was positioned to trip and the 21 MBFP tripped as designed but the MBFP discharge valve BFD-2-21 failed to fully close. MBFP discharge valve BFD-2-21 was declared inoperable and Technical Specification (TS) 3.7.3 (Main Feed water Isolation) Condition C (One or both MBFP discharge valves inoperable) was entered. Troubleshooting on the valve determined the close torque switch contact finger was out of position within the contact holder. This misalignment allowed the contact finger to move out of the proper position causing Motor Operated Valve (MOV) BFD-2-21 to fail to close. Direct cause was valve BFD-2-21 close torque- switch was out of position. The apparent cause was the MOV preventive maintenance procedure lacked the level of detail and direction to provide the appropriate guidance to recognize the susceptibility associated with the orientation of the close torque switch contact finger bracket opening and spreading of the "U" shape bracket.

As a result of the inspection, 227 baffle-former bolts were identified to have either visual anomalies or ultrasonic indications or could not be examined by ultrasonic testing. A visual inspection of the baffle-former plates and edge bolts showed no discernible material degradation or distortion. All other MRP-227-A inspections of the reactor vessel internals showed no other failures or premature degradation. The root cause of the failed baffle-former bolts is primarily Irradiation Assisted Stress Corrosion Cracking (IASCC) in combination with applied stresses and fatigue loads. Failure analyses will be conducted to confirm the cause for the degradation - of the baffle-former bolts. At the time of discovery, the unit was in a safe and stable condition with all fuel removed from the reactor vessel. The event had no impact on public health and safety.

On March 9, 2016, during shutdown for a refueling outage, while performing testing of the safety injection (SI) system, the Station Auxiliary Transformer (SAT) Load Tap Changer (LTC) failed to increase per design upon actuation of an SI signal. The condition was acceptable for the current mode but is unacceptable when the offsite AC electric power distribution and SI System is required to be operable. An investigation was performed and it was discovered on March 28, 2016, that the SAT control cabinet terminal blocks W105 and W106 had their links open thereby preventing proper operation of the LTC. A review of tests and Work Orders (WO) did not identify any previous failed tests or any WO with instructions to open the links. The last successful test of LTC operation was performed on February 26, 2014. The direct cause of the event was open links for the SAT LTC SI signal. The most probable apparent cause was maintenance activities by either IPEC or supplemental personnel that left the SAT states links W105 and W106 open during the 2014 spring outage (2R21). A review was performed of 42 Work Order (WO) tasks conducted during the 2014 spring outage. None of the WO tasks required work on the SAT LTC links or required work in the specific area of the states links.

Personnel were removing disassembled scaffolding from inside the crane wall on the 46 foot elevation of containment and moving it through the ECCS sump barrier gates {GATE} to areas outside the crane wall through the two open barrier gates. Having both sump barrier gates open violated ECCS operability basis which requires the sump barrier system to be operable in Modes 1-4. The plant had entered Mode 4 on July 10, 2016, at 23:30 hours. The inspector notified the operator touring with him of the observation. The operator subsequently coached the Radiation Protection (RP) door guard to ensure that one of the gates were closed at all times. No condition report recorded the event at the time. Subsequently, on June 20, 2016, after an NRC inspector advised a site manager the condition was recorded in the Indian Point Energy Center (IPEC) 
2472016008|1|CAUSE|1|The direct cause was recurring longitudinal solidification cracks that developed during welding of copper-nickel to carbon steel pipe. The primary degradation mechanism leading to the November '30, 2015 leak Was likely crevice corrosion, caused by small holidays in the internal coating at the field weld that allowed SW to contact the internal piping base metal. The corrosion promoted thinning in the affected area, which resulted in the development of a pin hole at the weakened toe of the carbon steel elbow to copper-nickel inlet nozzle field weld on the carbon steel. Surface exams performed during the RO repairs did not identify any defects. However, potential subsurface flaws would not be detected using the surface exam technique. During the RO and the June 2016 post outage repair work, repairs to the leaking indication initially used ERCuNi filler metal to restore the weld integrity. This method resulted in strain-induced longitudinal cracking in the highly restrained joint due to the relatively low tensile strength of the material, its thermal conductivity differences with carbon steel, and its susceptibility to iron dilution from steel, which can increase the tendency for brittle fracture. Standard industry practices to reduce cracking tendencies prior to joining dissimilar metals with filler material were not identified in the repair plan.

ABSTRACT (   On July 6, 2016,Instrument and Control (I) technicians were preparing to perform 2-PT-2M3A (RPS Logic Train B Actuation Logic Test and Tadot). Prior to starting the test, the I technicians were unable to locate key #184 that was identified in the test as associated with the reactor trip breaker B bypass key switch. Control Room staff recommended obtaining key #183 associated with reactor trip breaker A bypass key switch to use in lieu of key #184. To ensure the key would work prior to starting the test, the train B bypass key switch was positioned by an I technician to the Defeat position. Because reactor trip Bypass Breaker B was in the racked out position, when the key switch was taken to the Defeat position, it caused the normal Reactor Trip Breaker B to open, which initiated a reactor trip (RT) and auxiliary feed water system actuation. The direct cause was an I technician turned the key interlock to defeat on switchgear Channel B Reactor Protection Logic without having the BYB Bypass breaker racked in and closed. The root cause was Indian Point personnel emphasized work culture production goals without fully recognizing the need to maintain fundamental standards and expectations for nuclear workers. Key

Following the scram, the reactor mode switch was placed in the shutdown position. On April 16, 2000, at 0835 hours CDT, plant operators commenced performance of surveillance Reactor Protection System Mode Switch in Shutdown Scram and Logic System Functional Test. This test requires that the mode switch be moved out of the shutdown position. On April 17, 2000, at approximately 1735 hours CDT, following satisfactory completion of mode switch testing, it was determined that 3-SR-3.3.1.2.4, Source Range Monitor (SRM) System Count Rate and Signal to Noise Ratio Check, was not performed as required. The SR was subsequently completed at approximately 2235 hours CDT. SRMs A, B, and D were found to be operable. Following completion of the SRM system test, it was determined that the mode switch testing had been conducted in violation of an action statement for inoperable SRMs which required the mode switch to be in the shutdown position. Therefore, TVA is reporting this event in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73 (a)(2)(i)(B), as any operation or condition prohibited by the plants Technical Specifications. The root cause of this event was inadequate procedures, which resulted in misapplication of the requirements for operability of the SRMs.

ABSTRACT (   On April 25, 2016, while performing a walkdown of Control Room panels, it was noticed that the green indication light for High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) auxiliary lube oil pump (ALOP) was not illuminated. A non-licensed operator was dispatched to the HPCI ALOP starter and reported that the local indication lights were not illuminated. HPCI was declared inoperable at 2117 Central Daylight Time (CDT) resulting in entry into Technical Specifications (TS) ing Condition of Operation 3.5.1, Condition C, HPCI System Inoperable. Investigation determined that the coil in the electrical relay for the ALOP, which had recently been replaced during a preventive maintenance window, had failed after 133 hours of service. The cause of the failure was determined to be the prior pre-installation checks performed by NuTherm on the relay were inadequate to prevent the type of infant mortality failure that occurred in this case. HPCI was declared operable at 1314 CDT on April 26, 2016, after the coil was replaced. This event is being reported as a loss of safety function due to HPCI being a single-train safety system, as a condition prohibited by TS and in accordance with 10 CFR Part 21. The potential safety consequences of this event were minimal due to both the limited duration the condition existed and the redundant/diverse core cooling systems which remained operable.

ABSTRACT (   On September 14, 2016, during testing of the Reactor Recirculation Motor Generator Ventilation Air Operated Isolation Valves (AOV), HV-AOV-265 failed to close as required by Technical Specifications. Operations declared HV-AOV-265 inoperable and entered ing Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.6.4.2, Condition A, and commenced preparations to transition the plant to single loop operation, including reducing the plant to approximately 50 percent power. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the air supply line to the valve was pinched between the valve actuator and a scaffold that was erected to support work on a nearby component. After modifying the scaffold and replacing the pinched airline, the valve was tested satisfactorily and Operations exited the LCO and activities to prepare for transition to single loop operation were terminated. The root cause of the event is that personnel involved in the planning, construction, and inspection of the scaffold built for a nearby component were not aware of the unique external movement path of the valve actuator. To prevent recurrence, the procedure will be revised to include specific guidance for the planning, building and inspection of scaffolds in the vicinity of HV-AOV-265 and other AOVs having actuators of similar design. Signage has been installed to warn personnel of the external movement of these AOVs.

Reactor pressure was controlled using the Main Steam Line Drains; and the condensate/feed system was available for reactor water level control. On September 25, 2016, at 01:03 hours, while equalizing pressure across the MSIVs to below 200 psid, a differential pressure of 190 psid was established. Upon opening MS-AO-80A, a Group 1 isolation was immediately received due to a Main Steam Line high flow signal. The control room operators subsequently equalized pressure and successfully opened MS-AO-80A, as well as the remaining MSIVs, at 18:52 hours. The cause of the event was insufficient procedure guidance exists regarding limitations on opening the MSIVs. To correct this, the applicable procedure has been revised to change the differential pressure limitations for opening MSIVs from 200 psid to 80 psid. The safety significance of the event is low and did not pose a threat to the health and safety of the public.

ABSTRACT (   On October 28, 2016, during replacement of relay PCIS-REL-K27 at Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS), the action of installing a new relay onto the shared plastic DIN rail disturbed the mounting rail in a manner that caused contacts of the adjacent relay, PCIS-REL-K30, to open. This caused Shutdown Cooling (SDC) isolation valve RHR-MO-17 to close, which actuated the logic to trip the running 'A' Residual Heat Removal (RHR) pump. Operations declared 'A' RHR SDC subsystem inoperable at 09:24 hours and entered ing Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.9.7, Condition A, and Condition C. Alternate Decay Heat Removal remained in service throughout the event. Event Notification 52327 was made to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Operations Center. While SDC was out of service, PCIS-REL-K27 work was completed. SDC was declared operable at 05:30 hours on October 29, 2016, and was placed in service at 18:30 hours, and the LCO was exited. The root cause of the event is that CNS did not identify the risk from mechanical agitation during Primary Containment Isolation System (PCIS) relay installation; therefore, the risk was not adequately evaluated or mitigated. To prevent recurrence, CNS will revise Procedure 0.50.5 to list the relays or other devices which could impact SDC when in service. This is a Safety System Functional Failure. Page 2 of 4

Subsequently at 11:41 hours, RCIC was declared inoperable due to a water leak from the lube oiler cooler lower flange. During investigation it was determined that valve RCIC-AOV-PCV23, which was replaced during Refueling Outage 29, was full open causing excessive cooling water pressure to the lube oil cooler. This valve regulates cooling water to the lube oil cooler. Initial examination revealed that the actuator was purchased with a closed travel stop instead of the required open travel stop. The work order was revised to fabricate and install an open travel stop. On November 10, 2016, following valve modification, RCIC passed surveillance testing, was declared operable, and TS LCO 3.5.3, Condition A, exited. :The root cause evaluation determined that the correct air operated valve was not purchased because the material master purchase order text and associated drawing didn't detail the requirement of an open travel stop. To prevent recurrence, CNS will revise the material master purchase order text to state that the valve includes a travel stop in the open direction to limit valve travel. In addition, the drawing will be modified to show the correct travel stop with a note emphasizing the design function of the travel stop.

ABSTRACT (   From July 11, 2016, to July 15, 2016, the Torus area and Reactor Building floor drain valve control switches were placed in the OPEN position, per alarm card FP-1/C-4, due to fire detector FP-TD-19-2 being impaired. Subsequently, it was determined that by placing the floor drain valve control switches to OPEN, the automatic flood protection function that is credited in Cooper Nuclear Station's internal flooding analysis, was defeated. During the time the detector was impaired, there were no credited compensatory actions taken to ensure Division 1 Core Spray (CS) and Division 1 Residual Heat Removal (RHR) systems were protected from postulated flooding caused by a high-energy line break. As such, it was determined that both Division 1 CS and Division 1 RHR were inoperable for a period greater than allowed by Technical Specifications. The cause was determined to be that when the flooding requirements in the Reactor Building changed, a review of alarm cards did not identify alarm card FP-1/C-4 as needing updated. Alarm card FP-1/C-4 was revised to remove taking radwaste valves out of AUTO for each quad. In addition, the applicable procedure has been revised to ensure actions taken will ensure operability is maintained for environmentally qualified components in each of the Reactor Building quads; and a review of fire panel alarm cards will be performed for similar occurrences where monitoring is the only action taken.

In November 2015, the isolation valve for the pressure override defeat pressure transmitter was found closed. The pressure transmitter provides an input into the 21 AFW Pump run-out protection circuit. With the isolation valve closed, it would take longer to sense pump discharge head and consequently the opening of the auxiliary feed pump flow control valves would be slower than normal. This condition resulted in 21 Auxiliary Feed water Pump loop time response greater than Technical Specification (TS) acceptance criteria. The failed channel was not recognized and the TS action was not taken, resulting in a condition prohibited by TS. The investigation revealed that the condition most likely existed since April 20, 2015, when maintenance activities were performed on the auxiliary feed water pump discharge pressure transmitter.

3112016002|1|CAUSE|1|The generator trip, and subsequent automatic reactor trip, was initiated by the main generator automatic voltage regulator (AVR) STV1 volts/hertz over excitation protection relay. This relay tripped at a volts/hertz level less than the design set point (104.5% vs. 110%) during voltage manipulations to support a line outage. Failure analysis identified the cause of the trip as damage to the R14 rheostat on the STV1 relay card. This damage is attributable to either poor manufacturing quality or inadequate shipping and handling. This rheostat directly controls the set point at which the STV relay will trip for over excitation protection. This defect caused the relay to trip prior to its design value. The STV-1 relay could not be adjusted to within the manufacturer's acceptance criteria (+/-1%) with the failed R14 rheostat. The organization failed to develop and implement

BSTRACT (Unit  On 2/14/16 at 20:58 Salem Unit 2 automatically tripped from 100% power on Generator Protection. The trip was initiated due to a Main Turbine trip caused by a Main Generator Protection signal. All emergency core cooling systems and emergency safeguards feature systems functioned as expected. The motor driven and steam driven auxiliary feed pumps started as expected on steam generator low level. Operators stabilized the plant in Mode 3 with decay heat removal via the main steam dump valves and auxiliary feed water system. Condenser vacuum remained available for the duration of the event. Operators also ensured a normal offsite electrical power lineup. Investigation identified a Stator Water Cooling valve leak dripping onto a relay, shorting the relay wiring terminations. This caused the turbine generator trip.

3112016004|1|CAUSE|1|The 22 SGFP trip was a rate trip (-400 RPM increase in 300milliseconds) caused when the main steam poppet valve opened. A root cause evaluation was conducted for this event. The evaluation determined that one root cause was that the specification agreed upon by PSEG and the DFCS vendor did not identify the acceleration rate trip that was incorporated into the digital feed modification. An independent Critical Digital Review (CDR) was performed by an experienced independent vendor. The CDR did not identify the installation of the trip. The vendor was involved in the process throughout the entire lifecycle, from requirements definition to factory acceptance testing. The design requirements/specifications as defined by PSEG for the implementation of the modification did not identify the acceleration rate trip. The DFCS vendor was contacted and requested to validate that the acceleration rate trip was not discussed in the Functional requirements document. The response to the inquiry was 'The Trip on acceleration is NOT required; therefore it is not contained in the Functional Requirements Document" The trip function was installed without knowledge by engineering and the vendor had documentation identifying function/trip did exist, but did not specifically communicate the existence or functionality of the specific trip function. The acceleration rate trip will be removed from the system in accordance with the design change process. A second root cause identified was that the instructions for swapping from low pressure steam to high pressure steam provided in the procedure utilized did not include a conservative description/method for implementing a change in steam supply source to minimize speed perturbation. A review of data collected from the event was performed. The speed and demand signals specific to this event indicated a delta from previous start ups and a speed perturbation was experienced. The feed pump operation was performed within the requirements of the procedure and the review performed by this evaluation indicates that this was not the conservative method to operate/perform the transition from heating steam (HS) to main steam (MS). Additional guidance is required to prevent further speed perturbations.
3112016005|1|CAUSE|1|The direct cause for Salem Unit 2 turbine generator trip was an intermittent ground fault caused by a broken Current Transformer (CT) core ground wire that was intermittently touching the low voltage connections inside the transformer bushing compartment. The exact cause for the broken wire has not yet been determined yet. A Root Cause Evaluation is currently in progress. The preliminary report found that the CT wires were not secured to the transformer tank as expected. SAFETY CONSEQUENCES IMPLICATIONS There were no safety consequences as a result of this event. Operators appropriately responded to the reactor trip to stabilize the plant. All emergency core cooling systems and emergency safeguards feature systems functioned as expected. The motor driven and steam driven' auxiliary feed water pumps started as expected on steam generator low level. Operators stabilized .the plant in Mode 3 with decay heat removal via the main steam dump valves and auxiliary feed water system. Condenser vacuum remained available for the duration of the event. SAFETY  FUNCTIONAL FAILURE This condition did not result in a safety system functional failure as defined in NEI 99-02, Regulatory Assessment Performance Indicator Guidelines.

ABSTRACT (   At approximately 1500 hours on August 31, 2016, the 21 Reactor Coolant Pump (RCP) tripped resulting in an automatic reactor trip on low flow in one reactor coolant loop above the P-8 permissive (36% power permissive). As expected, the 21, 22 and 23 Auxiliary Feed water (AFW) pumps started on low steam generator level following the unit trip. Unit 2 was stabilized in Mode 3 at normal operating temperature and pressure with the 22, 23 and 24 RCPs in-service. The trip of the 21 RCP was caused by a Service Water (SW) leak that developed on the 22 Containment Fan Coil Unit (CFCU) motor cooler. The SW leaked on to the 21 RCP motor lead containment penetration and the motor leads in the termination box. This caused the A and C phase instantaneous overload relays to actuate causing the trip of the RCP and the subsequent reactor trip on low flow in one reactor coolant loop.

The penetrations are located in the floor of Turbine Building elevation 354 ft. Below the penetrations is the Auxiliary Building, housing safety related equipment. On March 17, 2016, it was identified that two penetration seals did not match approved fire penetration or approved flood seal details. Further investigation, completed on March 19, 2016, revealed that the two block-out penetrations were not grouted and represented a previously unknown vulnerability in a credited external flood barrier. The apparent cause of this event was less than adequate project management control for the size and scope of the External Flood Mitigation Project associated with post Fukushima Dai-ichi resolutions and requirements set forth by the NRC. Mitigating strategies and extent of condition reviews have been implemented for the identified conditions. Permanent repair of the deficient flood barriers is complete minus cure time. Actions to correct programmatic aspects of this condition are in progress.

N/A N/A N/A ABSTRACT (   On September 29, 2016, at Arkansas Nuclear One, Unit 1 (ANO-1), during refueling outage 1R26 with both trains of Decay Heat Removal (DHR) in service, a 0.125 gpm leak was identified in the DHR system at a one-inch drain line. This leak was on a section of cross-connect piping shared by both trains of the DHR system. The consequence of the leak was that both trains of the DHR system were declared inoperable. The leakage was due to a fatigue crack caused by vibration of the drain line due to a pipe support that was not designed for system vibration. Other systems and components in ANO-1 and ANO, Unit 2 (ANO-2) exposed to elevated system vibration were evaluated with respect to this condition. As a result of this evaluation, socket welds on other drains and vents in the ANO-1 DHR system were cut out and replaced, and pipe supports were modified where needed to withstand system vibration.

A refueling interlock of the main grapple was encountered while moving a double blade guide, caused by the disconnection of 20 Rod Position Information System (RPIS) Position Indicating Probes (PIPs). The operating crew began troubleshooting and determined that bypassing the RPIS probe "full-in" would clear the interlock. However the crew used a section of the site specific procedure for control rod withdrawal during refuel that wasn't applicable at the time. The RPIS indications were bypassed and the movement of the double blade guide was recommenced at 12:00 followed by fuel movement. After a review of Technical Specifications 3.9.4, it was determined that fuel movement should not be performed with the RPIS probe disconnected and bypassed because the associated control rods were not disarmed with a tagout. Fuel movement activities were then halted.

These activities are prohibited by Technical Specifications (TS) 3.6.4.1. However, recent NRC guidance provided in Enforcement Guidance Memorandum (EGM) 11-003, Revision 3 and in Regulatory Issue Summary (RIS) 2012-11 allowed the implementation of interim actions as an alternative to full compliance. These actions are compiled in the operating procedure for the OPDRV activities performed during the 2016 Hatch Unit 1 Refueling Outage in February. The performance of OPDRV activities were planned activities that were completed under the guidance of plant procedures and confirmed to have low safety significance based on interim actions taken. Since these actions were deliberate, no cause determination was necessary. A licensee amendment request (LAR) will be submitted following NRC approval of the Technical Specification Task Force (TSTF) Traveler associated with generic resolution of this issue (TSTF-542).

ABSTRACT (  r>During the 2016 Unit 1 R27 refueling outage, plans were put in place to upgrade the 1631-1RC-12BR-E-5 (1631-E5) design weld overlay (WOL) to a full structural weld overlay (FSWOL) in order to allow for code qualified examinations. On February 16, 2016 at 0631 EST, during surface preparation work, axial indications were found on the WOL. Evaluation of the indications found in the weld overlay suggests that the non-satisfactory PT examination was a result of the propagation of the original flaw that was found on the 1 E Recirculation Loop Piping. The original indication had propagated into the Incoiiel Alloy 82 WOL material installed in 1988. It was determined that the as-found condition of the flaw did not meet ASME Section XI acceptance criteria. The indications were removed from the WOL and 1B31-E5 was upgraded to a full structural weld overlay using intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IGCSS) resistant Alloy 52 weld material.
3212016004|1|CAUSE|1|The SRV pilots were disassembled and inspected while investigating the reason for the drift. SNC has determined that the linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) used to measure displacement confirmed the abutment gap closed pre-maturely. The pre-mature abutment gap closure is most likely due to loose manufacturing tolerances leading to SRV setpoint drift. ABILITY ANALYSIS SAFETY ASSESSMENT This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) because a condition occurred that is prohibited by TS 3.4.3. Specifically, an example of multiple test failures is given in NUREG-1022, Revision 3, "Event Reporting Guidelines 10 CFR 50.72 and 50.73" which describes the sequential testing of safety valves. This example notes that "Sometimes multiple valves are found to lift with set points outside of technical specification limits." NUREG-1022 further states in the example that "discrepancies found in TS surveillance tests should be assumed to occur at the time of the test unless there is firm evidence, based on a review of relevant information (e.g., the equipment history and the cause of failure), to indicate that the discrepancy occurred earlier. However, the existence of similar discrepancies in multiple valves is an indication that the discrepancies may well have arisen over a period of time and the failure mode should be evaluated to make this determination." Based on this guidance, the determination was made that this "as found" condition is reportable under the reporting requirements of 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B).

At that time, an electrical fault occurred on a balance of plant 4160-volt bus, resulting in a lockout of the Startup Auxiliary Transformer (SAT) and a loss of both Reactor Recirculation pumps. Licensed personnel inserted a manual scram per procedure. Emergency Diesel Generators supplied emergency electrical busses until offsite power was restored at 1628 EST. The loss of power and reactor water level changes resulted in automatic closures of various Primary Containment Isolation Valves (PCIVs). The electrical fault resulted in an electrical explosion; therefore, an Alert was declared at 1326 EDT. The immediate cause of this event was a fault in a non-segregated electrical bus connected to the SAT. The root causes were insufficient detail in applicable maintenance instructions for inspecting the non-segregated bus housing and inadequate instructions for terminating electrical cables in a circuit breaker cubicle.

At this time, EDG 1, Emergency bus El, and balance of plant (BOP) bus 1D were inoperable due to planned maintenance. Two inoperable EDGs represents a loss of safety function, for the onsite standby power source. Therefore, this condition is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D), as an event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of a system that is needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. In addition, it was determined that EDG 3 was inoperable for greater than Technical Specifications (TSs) Completion Times. Therefore, this condition is also being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as operation prohibited by the TSs. Additionally, on March 3, work was ongoing to restore power to BOP bus 1D when an error in the restoration sequence resulted in an invalid auto-start of EDGs 2 and 4.

3252016004|1|CAUSE|1|The vulnerability of the control cables for Unit 2 NSW pump "B" to a tornado missile has existed since original plant construction. Safety Assessment The purpose of the NSW system is to provide cooling water for safety-related plant equipment such as the Emergency Diesel Generators [EK] and Emergency Core Cooling System pump seals and room coolers, and to serve as the Ultimate Heat Sink for the plant. Two occasions in the past three years were identified in which a required NSW pump was inoperable for greater than seven days, twelve hours. During this time, at least one NSW pump remained operable on each unit, ensuring the safety function was met. CSW pumps were also available and can be used to supply NSW headers on both units. Per EGM 15-002, the NRC has analyzed risk generically for tornado-generated missiles. The analysis supports the characterization of the risk as of low significance. Based on this analysis, this event had no adverse impact on the health and safety of the public. 
3252016005|1|CAUSE|1|During accident conditions, cables exposed to rapidly changing temperatures can produce electrical currents large enough to cause false indications of high radiation. The TIC phenomenon was made known to the nuclear power industry via NRC Information Notice 97-45, Supplement 1, "Environmental Qualification Deficiency for Cables and Containment Penetration Pigtails." BSEP's initial assessment concluded that the effect of TIC upon the DWHRRMs was too small to appreciably affect their performance in a design basis accident. A new review cast doubt on that conclusion because documentation of the initial assessment contained no rigorous basis for the assumption that BSEP's cables were bounded by those tested by EPRI. Therefore, the DWHRRMs were conservatively declared inoperable. Safety Assessment The purpose of the DWHRRMs is to provide operators with indication of radiation conditions inside the primary containment following an accident. Radiation conditions, in turn, are used to assess the integrity of the fuel cladding and provide input for emergency action levels (EALs) to classify a plant emergency. The affected monitors would continue to function despite their susceptibility to TIC, but could indicate radiation levels higher than actual if cables were exposed to increasing temperatures, or lower than actual if cables were exposed to decreasing temperatures. Radiation indications would be inaccurate only during times when temperature in the drywell was rapidly changing. When temperature changes in the drywell grew smaller or stopped, inaccuracy in the DWHRRMs would diminish or vanish entirely. During times when the accuracy of the DWHRRMs might appear questionable, alternative methods of assessing the condition of the fuel are available to operators as provided in existing plant procedure OPLP-37, "Equipment Important to Emergency Preparedness and ERO Response." The DWHRRMs do not control any other structures, systems, or components. Based on this analysis, this event had no adverse impact on the health and safety of the public.

ABSTRACT (   On December 13, 2016, Units 1 and 2 were in Mode 1 (i.e., Run mode) at 98 percent and 97 percent of rated thermal power, respectively. At that time, shift personnel were notified that structural supports for the 2D Control Room air conditioning system condenser were corroded. An operability assessment found the affected air conditioning system inoperable due to the effect on its seismic qualification. Technical Specifications (TS) 3.7.4, Condition A, was entered. On January 30, 2017, the 1D air conditioning system was found with similar conditions. The duration of the condition and the fact that more than one air conditioning system was inoperable simultaneously resulted in the plant operating in a condition prohibited by the TS and in a loss of the safety function. This event resulted from a lack, in some cases, of station personnel being cognizant of risks related to resolving complex, long-standing issues that continue to degrade over time. All affected support steel was replaced by February 2, 2017. The remaining air conditioner was inspected and found acceptable. Administrative actions will be taken to identify high consequence plant issues and periodically reassess priorities.

ABSTRACT (   On February 9, 2016, at 1415 Eastern Standard Time, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Unit 1 experienced a Low Steam Line Pressure Safety Injection (SI) signal. At the time of the event, Operations was warming the main steam (MS) line downstream of the main steam isolations valves (MSIV) via the Loop 2 MSIV bypass valve. During this controlled evolution, a sudden drop in MS line pressure occurred that actuated the two-out-of-three logic as sensed on all three Loop 2 steam line pressure bi-stables. All safety systems responded as designed and the SI was terminated per procedure. Prior to the event, Unit 1 was recovering from a forced outage involving a Main Generator Blower repair that began on December 26, 2016. Unit 1 was maintained in Mode 3 during this time. The most probable cause of the SI actuation was determined to be water accumulation in MS Loop 2 upstream of the MSIV as a result of steam condensation not being drained during the extended Mode 3 forced outage. Troubleshooting was initiated and Unit 1 was placed in Mode 4 to facilitate draining of Loop 2 and 3 MS lines. s include actions to address operating for extended periods of time in Mode 4 and above with MSIVs closed.

ABSTRACT (   On May 16, 2016, at 2105 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) identified a nonconforming condition involving the Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) fire dampers installed for Units 1 and 2. Specifically, it has been identified that if a tornado causes a differential pressure across the east and west sides of the EDG Building, the associated ventilation fire dampers have not been analyzed to withstand the corresponding high air flow rate that could result from this condition and could possibly fail in a way that impedes airflow for EDG cooling. On June 8, 2016, at 1526 EDT, SQN determined that a tornado could potentially cause actuation of the EDG crankcase pressure trip due to a low barometric condition that could result in an EDG lockout condition. The EDG lockout condition prevents subsequent EDG starts (normal or emergency) until operators manually reset the lockout condition locally at the EDG.

Surveillance Requirement 3.6.8.1 requires greater than or equal to 33 ignitors energized in each train. With the breaker open, there were less than 33 ignitors operable. Technical Specification (TS) 3.6.8, Hydrogen Mitigation System (HMS), Condition A was entered. At 0916 EDT, June 7, 2016, the breaker was closed restoring operability to the two hydrogen ignitors and TS 3.6.8 Condition A was exited. A past operability evaluation, determined that the breaker panel associated with the two ignitors was last accessed on March 11, 2016, as part of the performance of a work order. It is assumed that the breaker became aligned to the open position during this work. Therefore, one train of the HMS was inoperable for longer than allowed by TSs. However, Train B HMS remained operable during this event. The cause for the breaker being in the open position is indeterminate.

Instrumentation & Control (I) maintenance personnel performed the channel calibration using a digital multi-meter (DMM) that defaulted to a lower impedance setting than the DMM normally used for the calibration. This impacted the set points. As a result, Delta-T/Tavg Channel IV was adjusted incorrectly and returned to service (the Over temperature delta-T (OTDT) trip function was taken out of the tripped condition) on June 25, 2016, at 0215 Eastern Daylight Time. On June 27, 2016, Reactor Engineering noticed that Tavg had taken a step change lower following the card replacement. On June 29, 2016, operators authorized performance of a functional test for Delta-T/Tavg Channel IV and Unit 1 entered Technical Specification (TS) 3.3.1 Conditions A and E. During the functional test, Delta-T/Tavg was found to be out of TS tolerance. Following adjustment, on June 29 at 2205 operators declared Delta-T/Tavg Channel IV operable.

SUBMI     ABSTRACT (   On August 2, 2016, during review of the Emergency Gas Treatment System (EGTS) circuits, Engineering discovered that the EGTS may automatically swap from the flow control path in A-Auto to the Standby flow control path upon the start of a design basis event (DBE). The intended design of the EGTS swap-over circuit was to detect an actual failure of the control path in A-Auto and swap to the Standby control path. The unnecessary automatic swap to Standby could prevent the EGTS train, configured in A-Auto, from performing its required safety function during a DBE. On August 5, at 1658 eastern daylight time (EDT), the condition was resolved when the automatic swap-over circuit was disabled. On August 17, at 1722 EDT a past operability evaluation determined the configuration of the EGTS flow controllers constituted an unanalyzed condition that significantly degraded plant safety due to the EGTS not meeting single failure criteria. Engineering analysis determined that the failure of both trains of EGTS controllers would not result in exceeding 10 CFR 100 limits. The cause of the event was that the EGTS control circuitry was not designed to account for situations that should have been anticipated.

ABSTRACT (   On August 10, 2016, at 1000 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), the Maintenance Instrument Group (MIG) performed a surveillance instruction (SI) that resulted in a fire protection damper associated with the Control Room Emergency Ventilation System (CREVS) actuating to a closed position. On August 11, at 1015 EDT, the fire damper was discovered in the closed position. The closure of the fire protection damper resulted in both trains of CREVS being inoperable due to the loss of air circulation and habitability of the Technical Support Center and Relay Room. Both units entered Technical Specification ing Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.7.10, Conditions A and G. Condition G requires immediate entry into LCO 3.0.3. At 1159 EDT, on August 11, actions were taken to open the fire damper and both trains of CREVS were declared operable. This allowed both units to exit LCO 3.0.3 and LCO 3.7.10, Conditions A and G. The cause of the event was determined to be inadequate breaker alignment instructions in the SI. 
3272016009|1|CAUSE|1|A. Cause of each component or system failure or personnel error: During startup, the stationary gripper of control rod H-6 was mechanically bound during initial control rod latching. Westinghouse provided information that this was a known potential issue during initial control rod movement; however, SQN did not incorporate this operating experience (OE) into site procedures. As a result, SQN procedures did not have a method to ensure the stationary grippers were not bound during initial rod movement. This led to a misaligned rod. B. Cause(s) and circumstances for each human performance related root cause: No human performance issues were identified. IV. Analysis of the Event: Prior to the manual reactor trip, SQN Unit 1 was in Mode 3 following a planned refueling outage. Reactor Coolant System (RCS) [EIIS: AB] pressure and temperature were approximately 2235 pounds per square inch gauge and 548 degrees Fahrenheit. Both the motor driven and the turbine driven AFW pumps, and steam dump valves, and the atmospheric relief valves were available. The plant responded as expected for the conditions of the trip. V. Assessment of Safety Consequences There were no safety consequences as a result of the event. All safety systems functioned as designed during the manual reactor trip and there were no radiation releases due to this event. SQN Unit 1 was not yet critical at the time of this manual reactor trip. The assessment tool used to evaluate risk during startup to the point of reactor criticality is the Equipment Out-of-Service (EGOS) shut down safety model. All defense-in-depth safety requirements evaluated in the SQN shutdown safety model were satisfactorily met at the time of the trip, indicating the overall risk level was low. A. Availability of systems or components that could have performed the same function as the components and systems that failed during the event: No systems or components failed as a result of the manual reactor trip actuation. B. For events that occurred when the reactor was shut down, availability of systems or components needed to shutdown the reactor and maintain safe shutdown conditions, remove residual heat, control the release of radioactive material, or mitigate the consequences of an accident: Page 4 of 5

At 89 percent power, at 22:23, Operators began taking compensatory measures to reduce power and mitigate water level lowering. At 22:40, a manual scram was initiated. The scram was complicated by a residual transfer that resulted in non-vital equipment trips. This event resulted in the manual actuation of the Reactor Protection System, High Pressure Coolant Injection, Reactor Core Isolation Cooling, Main Steam Isolation Valves and automatic actuation of Emergency Diesel Generators, Emergency Service Water, and containment isolations in multiple systems, reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A). The lowering screenwell water level was caused by frazil ice blockage at the intake structure. The frazil ice stopped affecting screenwell water level after the manual scram.

FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant was operating at 100% power. A fault in transformer 71T-5 caused a trip of circuit breaker 71-10340. Power was lost to 2 of 3 Reactor Building Closed Loop Cooling (RBCLC) pumps and 2 of 3 lube oil pumps for the Motor-Generator (MG) Set for 'A' Reactor Water Recirculation (RWR). The 'A' RWR pump tripped immediately causing reactor power to reduce to approximately 50%. The remaining RBCLC pump was inadequate to maintain the MG Set fluid drive oil temperature for the 'B' RWR pump so Operators initiated a manual scram at 1236. This event is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A). The power loss also affected Reactor Building Ventilation (RBV). This system supports the requirement of Technical Specification Surveillance Requirement 3.6.4.1.1 for a differential pressure in Secondary Containment. At the loss of RBV, Secondary Containment automatically isolated and the Standby Gas Treatment system was manually initiated. However, during this short transition the differential pressure requirement was not met. This report is being submitted per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C). The apparent cause of the 71T-5 fault was inadequate preventative maintenance which allowed the transformer to remain in service beyond expected service life.

At 1500 hours FPL declared the containment high range radiation monitors (CHRRMs) inoperable on both Units. FPL determined that the resolution of the-.NRC Information Notice (IN) 97-45 industry Operating Experience (OE) concerning CHRRMs cabling was less than adequate. The assumed CHRRMs design accuracy could not be assured during some postulated design basis accidents due to the errors introduced by thermal induced currents and water intrusion/cable blistering within the associated detectors' cabling, resulting in inoperable CHRRMs. The Technical Specifications (TSs) require pre-planned alternate means for containment radiation monitoring for inoperable CHRRMs; these requirements were not implemented until June 2016. FPL also submitted a TS 6.9.2 Special Report for two channels of inoperable CHRRMs. This legacy event was caused by the inadequate evaluation and improper tracking of actions required to fully close the nonconformance identified in the 1997 Information Notice. CHRRMs are used for information, they are not used to control radioactive releases or mitigate accidents. Their inoperability had no significant impact on the health and safety of the public. FPL plans to replace the CHRRMs cabling susceptible to the phenomenon identified in NRC Information Notice 97-45 and its supplement 1.

ABSTRACT (   On August 5, 2016, during Unit 1 restart following a maintenance outage, operators observed excessive seat leakage past a Reactor Coolant System (RCS) pressure isolation check valve. The flow path was promptly identified and isolated. A leak test was planned and performed at higher RCS pressure to quantify the leakage. The seat leak test at normal operating pressure was halted when an appropriate differential pressure was not achieved for testing. As a result, V3217, Safety Injection Loop 1A2 Check Valve, was declared inoperable, and Unit 1' was placed in Mode 5 COLD SHUTDOWN to complete repairs. The leakage past V3217 was caused by inadequate maintenance practices and procedures that did not ensure V3217 was within acceptable tolerances and correctly assembled in 2013. Cofrective actions inclUde revisions to procedures for check valve maintenance, check valve trending and check valve preventive maintenance. This event is reportable pursuant to.10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications. Since this condition was identified with Unit 1 in HOT STANDBY prior to reactor startup, the leaking check valve had no direct nuclear safety significance or impact to the environment.

ABSTRACT (   On August 21, 2016, during Unit 1 restart following a maintenance outage, an unexpected actuation of the Main Generator Inadvertent Energization Lockout Relay caused the main generator to trip, resulting in an automatic reactor trip. The generator lockout prevented the automatic transfer of station auxiliaries to the available startup transformer power, requiring the emergency diesel generators to start and power the safety related buses. Reactor coolant pumps normally powered through the non-safety buses were deenergized, and decay heat removal was via natural circulation and Auxiliary Feed water. The lockout relay actuation was caused by a latent error introduced during a 2013 design modification where the maintenance configuration control procedure did not prevent a wire from being inadvertently removed from the circuit.

ABSTRACT (   At 1514 EST on January 6, 2016, while operating at 100 percent Reactor Thermal Power (RTP), the East and West Turbine Bypass Valves (TBV) automatically opened as expected for 3 minutes and 32 seconds in response to the number one High Pressure Turbine Stop Valve (TSV) drifting from full open to 25 percent open due to an actuator malfunction. Per Technical Specification (TS) Bases 3.3.1.1, TBVs must remain shut while RTP is at or above 29.5 percent to consider all channels of the TSV closure and Turbine Control Valve (TCV) fast closure Reactor Protection System (RPS) functions operable. Reactor Operators lowered RTP to 91.0 percent and at 1518 EST the TBV automatically closed and the TSV closure and TCV fast closure RPS functions were no longer considered inoperable. TS 3.3.1.1 requires that the TSV closure and TCV fast closure RPS functions be operable at or above 29.5 percent RTP. In this event, during the period of time while TBVs were open, reactor power was maintained above 91 percent and the RPS functions were confirmed to be enabled. The actuator malfunction was caused by faulty connectors within the actuator. The faulty connectors were replaced.

ABSTRACT (   On January 22, 2016, at 1923 EST, both divisions of the Residual Heat Removal (RHR) system were declared inoperable for the Low Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI) mode of operation due to a failure of the division 1 LPCI outboard injection motor operated valve (MOV), El 1 50F017A. While performing the division 1 RHR pump and valve operability surveillance test, E1150F017A closed properly but failed to open during its required stroke time test. With this valve closed and unable to automatically open, LPCI injection into the Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) from both divisions of RHR would be prevented if the LPCI loop select logic selected the division 1 recirculation loop for injection; therefore, this failure rendered both divisions of RHR inoperable for the LPCI function. Technical Specification limiting condition for operation (LCO) 3.5.1, Condition K, was entered, which requires immediate entry into LCO 3.0.3. The cause of the failure was subsequently identified as a foreign material (screw) that affected the function of the MOV contactor. The root cause was determined to be less than adequate inspection procedures and susceptibility of the contactor to foreign material. Inspection of all other susceptible equipment is ongoing to tighten loose screws and a modification is planned to install Foreign Material Exclusion (FME) barriers.

ABSTRACT (   At 1629 EDT on August 25, 2016, it was determined that an inadequate interpretation of Fermi 2 Technical Specification (TS) 3.7.2 was being utilized. For an Ultimate Heat Sink (UHS) divisional reservoir to be operable, two Mechanical Draft Cooling Tower (MDCT) fans in that division are required to be operable. The MDCT fans have a brake system to prevent fan overspeed during a tornado. Fermi 2 procedures had directed personnel to declare the MDCT fans and UHS reservoir inoperable due to nonfunctionality of the brake system only if a tornado watch or warning was in effect for the area near Fermi 2. The correct interpretation of TS 3.7.2 would be to declare the MDCT fans and UHS reservoir inoperable any time the brake system was nonfunctional. Following discovery of the inadequate interpretation of TS, a review of the brake system for the past three years was performed. The review identified 15 occurrences where the brake system was nonfunctional and should have resulted in entry to TS 3.7.2. These 15 occurrences resulted in operations or conditions prohibited by TS since TS Required Actions were not completed within their Completion Times. In addition, 5 of the 15 were also instances where the plant configuration was such that it could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems. Finally, 4 of the 15 were instances where the plant was in an unanalyzed condition. There were no radiological releases associated with this event. There was no credible threat of a tornado during any of the 15 occurrences. The safety significance was determined to be very low. The cause of the event was an incorrect proceduralized TS interpretation. s were taken to revise the procedure.

ABSTRACT (   At 1644 EDT on April 24, 2016, while operating at 100 percent Reactor Thermal Power, the potential transformer (PT) primary fuses on I3us 64C were found blown, resulting in half of the Loss of Power (LOP) instrumentation relays tripping on Bus 64C. Initially, the LOP instrumentation was incorrectly considered OPERABLE; however, later reviews of the condition determined that the LOP instrumentation was inoperable. Later reviews also concluded that the Division 1 Alternating Current (AC) Source was inoperable from 1644 to 1920 on April 24, 2016, and the Division 1 Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) 12 was inoperable starting at 1644 on April 24, 2016, until it was restored at 1818 on May 8, 2016, during a Forced Outage following replacement of the blown PT fuses. On six occasions from April 26-30, 2016, Division 2 EDGs 13 and/or 14 were inoperable for planned surveillances. Therefore, this is an event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function to remove residual heat and mitigate the consequences of an accident. Furthermore, failure to enter applicable ing Conditions for Operation resulted in a condition prohibited by Technical 'Specifications. The cause of the event was concluded to be a low energy transient event resulting in the blown PT primary fuses. The incorrect initial operability determination was caused by Operators being unfamiliar with this equipment condition. Operators completed a Department Event Free Day Reset and Event Review and will receive additional training on this condition.

ABSTRACT (   On October 28, 2016, at 1500 EDT, Fermi 2 Operators declared both subsystems of Standby Liquid Control (SLC) inoperable due to the sodium pentaborate concentration in the SLC storage tank being outside of the Technical Specification (TS) requirements. The sodium pentaborate concentration had been measured in response to the receipt of the SLC storage tank high level alarm. The demineralized water isolation valves that could cause a dilution of the tank were verified to be closed. Actions were initiated to add sodium pentaborate to the SLC storage tank to raise the concentration. SLC was declared operable at 1935 EDT following a measurement that verified that sodium pentaborate concentration had been restored to within the TS requirements. The cause of the event was determined to be leak-by of the demineralized water isolation valves that had caused an increase in SLC storage tank level and, therefore, a decrease in sodium pentaborate concentration. The leak-by had been occurring for some time and had gone undetected. The cause of the leak-by not being detected was determined to be inadequate system monitoring.

ABSTRACT (   On November 2, 2016, a non-conservatism in the current Fermi 2 design and licensing basis of the control rod drop accident (CRDA) was identified. The current analysis assumes that the fission products released as a result of a CRDA are transported to the condenser and then released from there. An unanalyzed condition was identified where a forced release from the Gland Seal Exhausters (GSEs) could occur which would exceed dose limits in 10 CFR 100.11 and Standard Review Plan 6.4 when operating at low reactor power conditions. The postulated fuel damage and associated release is only credible for low power conditions of less than 10% power. Fermi 2 was at 97% power at the time of discovery and, therefore, the condition did not exist. I lowever, a review of past operating conditions identified five instances in the past three years where Fermi 2 operated at less than 10% power. Based on a subsequent engineering analysis, for each of those five instances, plant conditions and available equipment were such that dose limits would have been met even if a postulated CRDA had occurred during those times; therefore, there was no adverse impact to public health and safety or to plant employees. There were no radiological releases. The cause of the event was that the original design and licensing basis analysis of the CRDA did not evaluate the direct release of steam from the GSEs, and, therefore, the plant was not designed to mitigate the potential consequences associated with that release path.

ABSTRACT (   ' On January 29, 2016 at 1322 hours, with the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station operating at approximately 100 percent power, an automatic reactor trip occurred due to the actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS). Nuclear Instrumentation calibration for RPS Channel 2 was in progress. RPS Channel 2 was in bypass and Channel 1 was inoperable/tripped due to an existing Reactor Coolant System (RCS) temperature element (RTD) issue. A fuse failure in an input to RPS Channel 4 caused RPS Channel 4 trip on Flux/Delta-Flux/Flow, resulting in the reactor trip. Post trip, the Steam Feed water Rupture Control System (SFRCS) actuated due to high Steam Generator (SG) 1 level, initiating the Auxiliary Feed water (AFW) System. The cause of the SFRCS actuation was an improper response by the Integrated Control System (ICS) after the reactor trip. ICS Rapid Feed water Reduction. (RFR) circuit did not actuate and the ICS SG/Reactor Demand Hand/Auto Station transferred from automatic control to manual. 
3462016002|1|CAUSE|1|The direct cause of the event was insufficient pressure in the piping upstream of the MFW to SG 1 Check valve (FW147), resulting in the SFRCS Actuation. When MFW to SG 1 Isolation Valve (FW612) was opening, the downstream SG pressure of approximately 870 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) was immediately applied to the downstream side of MFW to SG 1 Check Valve (FW147), developing greater than 125 pounds per square inch differential (psid) reverse DP, thus causing the SFRCS SG 1 High Reverse DP trip. The unexpected SFRCS SG 1 High Reverse D/P trip resulted in the reclosure of affected valves, including the MFW Isolation Valves, as designed. The AFW Pumps remained in operation, as expected. The MDFP remained operating aligned to the MFW Header and continued to pressurize the piping between the FW Heaters up to the MFW Isolation Valves. The apparent cause of the event is that less than adequate procedural guidance is contained in procedure DB-OP-06910, Trip Recovery. The guidance in this procedure was inadequate to ensure that the MFW piping segment between MFW Bypass Throttle Valve (FW139) and MFW to SG 1 Isolation Valve (FW612) was sufficiently pressurized prior to opening MFW to SG 1 Isolation Valve (FW612).. ANALYSIS The SFRCS is a protection system required to actuate AFW to the SG's to remove reactor decay heat during periods when normal feed water supply has been lost and/or upon loss of power to the RCP motors. Crossover piping exists that may be used to direct feed water from either AFW source to either SG. The SFRCS also functions to isolate steam and main feed water lines to mitigate overcooling events caused by steam depressurization: At the time of the event, the AFW System was operating and feeding the Steam Generators. The unit remained in Mode 3 and stable. This actuation did not have any negative impact to the AFW system and the ability to feed the steam generators. A bounding quantitative evaluation of risk impact was performed, using best available information, which estimated the delta Core Damage Frequency (CDF) to be 4.9E-07/yr. Based on this analysis, this event is considered to have a very low safety significance. Reportability Discussion: The Auxiliary Feed water System by the SFRCS on a valid reverse differential pressure is reportable within 8 hours of the event in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A). This notification was completed at 07:32 on January 30, 2016 (Event Number 51702). The receipt of an actuation signal of the Auxiliary Feed water System and the actuation/closure of several main steam system valves is reportable as a Licensee Event Report per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A). All safety systems performed as required in response to the event, and no loss of safety function occurred.
3462016003|1|CAUSE|1|: A laboratory failure examination was unable to confirm the pressure boundary leak path, but a partial depth weld solidification crack was observed in the Alloy 625 pressure boundary material at the hose / bellows tube to socket end. A similar through-wall weld solidification crack at the flange to hose / bellows tube pressure boundary weld was likely the source for the boric acid leakage for the RCP 1-1 first stage seal cavity vent line. Therefore, the direct cause of the RCP 1-1, first stage seal cavity vent line pressure boundary leakage was likely a weld solidification crack during manufacture. Each of the other identified failure modes from operation, installation, manufacture, and design were refuted. The DBNPS had three (3) uninstalled spare flexible hose assemblies also supplied in the same batch as the leaking hose for the RCP 1-1 first stage seal cavity vent line. These spare hose assemblies were subsequently bubble tested (30 psig air pressure for 10 minutes) and helium tracer probe leak tested. All three (3) uninstalled spare flexible hose assemblies passed the bubble test, but one (1) failed the helium tracer probe leak test acceptance criteria. Helium tracer probe leak testing of the uninstalled spare hose assemblies permits increased sensitivity for detection of extremely small leaks. Helium tracer probe leak testing was proven an effective barrier that could have mitigated or prevented shipment of the flexible hose assembly with pressure boundary leakage. Therefore, the root cause of the pressure boundary leak path (weld solidification crack) not being detected during manufacture was less than adequate quality control inspection after manufacture of the flexible hose assemblies such that an extremely small pressure boundary defect was not detected by liquid penetrant and hydrostatic testing at 1.5 times design pressure (3750 psig) for 10 minutes. ANALYSIS : Because the RCP first stage seal cavity vent piping is classified, as ASME Section III Class 2 piping, in the event of a postulated failure, per design the reactor can be shut down and cooled down in an orderly manner assuming seal injection is maintained by the Makeup System. The estimated leak rate was well within the capability of the Makeup System's capability. Therefore this event was of very low safety significance. Reportability Discussion: Based on existing precedence, this leak was determined to be reportable per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(A) as degradation of a principal safety barrier; namely, the RCS, due to the material degradation (weld leak). The NRC was verbally notified of this event at 0014 hours on March 31, 2016, via Event Number 51837. This issue is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A) as degradation of a principal safety barrier. Additionally, as this is RCS Pressure Boundary leakage and it potentially could have existed with the plant in operation, contrary to TS LCO 3.4.13, which does not allow any Pressure Boundary leakage, this issue is also being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as operation or condition prohibited by Technical Specifications. No safety functions were lost as a result of this issue and all TS required actions
3462016004|1|CAUSE|1|: While analyzing the cause, it was identified that two Engineering Change Packages (ECPs) were developed and implemented to replace the six dual-element RTDs during the Steam Generator Replacement Project (SGRP) in 2014. One ECP was written to support piping insulation removal and re-installation with a new, more effective insulation; and the second ECP was written to support RTD replacement. During comment resolution of the RTD ECP, the EQ Engineer provided comments and statements pertaining to insulation requirements that were not fully addressed and were not ultimately passed on to the engineer responsible for the piping insulation ECP. Additional individual errors were made during ECP development and work order along with post-implementation walkdown. Basic work practice weaknesses resulted in incorrect design development and implementation of the piping insulation for the RTD thermowells. The direct cause of the RTD conductor wiring insulation degradation was accelerated aging due to high temperatures located at the RTD termination head. This wiring degradation was as a result of improper configuration of piping insulation on the RTD extension stem during the previous outage. The apparent cause of the incorrect piping insulation configuration was due to incorrect and insufficient guidance provided in the piping insulation Engineering Change Package. The cause of the backward installation of the Midlock Ferrules on RTDs TERC3B5 and TERC3A4 is that less than adequate instructions were available to support the successful assembly and installation of the Conax ECSAs. ANALYSIS : The wire insulation degradation on the RC Hot Leg RTD, TERC3B2, resulted in the output temperature indication to deviate in the downward direction and thus it was unable to perform its intended function of providing Channel 1 input to the RPS for a High Temperature Trip or a Pressure/Temperature Trip. The RPS High Temperature Trip provides backup protection for RCS overheating events and is not used as the primary trip function for any accident analysis. The RCS Pressure/Temperature Trip is the primary trip for only a RCS letdown line rupture accident. Since the RPS trips associated with these instruments are high temperature trips and the failure mechanism caused by the insulation damage is a failed low condition, the insulation damage would not have resulted in a plant trip or transient, arid therefore would not cause an initiating event, nor the reactor trips associated with those instruments, for mitigating any accidents or transients.

3462016005|1|CAUSE|1|: Operating Procedure DB-OP-06902, Power Operations, provides operating instructions for Main Turbine startup at 18 percent power through full power operation as well as reactor shutdown. Step 4.6.5 of DB-OP-06902 instructs the operator to verify ARTS is enabled prior to reaching 45 percent power. The direct cause for the ARTS Trip Bypass being left in bypass for SFRCS and Main Turbine during startup is the reactor operator failed to fully read and understand procedure DB-OP-06902 step 4.6.5 prior to verifying ARTS enabled at approximately 40 percent power. The operator did not preview/review the task/procedure before performance. The root cause of this event is the operators failed to effectively work as a team to ensure a safety system was in an operable condition prior to the mode of applicability for plant startup. The operators were ineffective in their advocacy to understand why ARTS was in bypass and failed to get a critical review of assumptions they made that plant startup procedures would, at some point, restore ARTS. A contributing cause to this event is some procedures were not developed in accordance with approved processes and did not contain specific guidance for restoration of ARTS after all 'four channels of all parameters were placed in bypass. This was evident in temporary Test Procedure DB-TP-10405, Digital Control Rod Drive System (DCRDCS) Post Installation Testing for ECP 12-0272 as well as other operating procedures. ANALYSIS : With the ARTS channels in bypass, the anticipatory reactor trip signal on a Main Turbine Trip would not have been provided. The reactor trip output function of SFRCS, since it uses the ARTS trip as its means of tripping the reactor, would likewise have been disabled. All of the other features of the SFRCS (e.g., start Auxiliary Feed water Pumps [AB-P], align valves to isolate and/or feed water to the, Steam Generators [AB-SG]) would still have functioned. As stated above, the ARTS, including the SFRCS reactor trip function to ARTS, is 'not credited to mitigate the consequences of any UFSAR accident. The Davis-Besse Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) model does not model ARTS or credit it for tripping the reactor or mitigating any accidents or transients. All of the SFRCS functions which are modeled in the PRA were still available (e.g., start Auxiliary Feed water Pumps, align valves to isolate and/or feed water to the Steam Generators). Other protective systems such as the Reactor Protection System [JC] and the Safety Features Actuation System [JE] were functional, and the Immediate Action for an SFRCS trip indication is for the Control Room Operators to manually trip the reactor. The switch mispositioning occurred while the plant was at a reduced power level of 53 percent and with minimal decay heat in the core, as it occurred during startup from a refueling outage. The plant was in this condition for approximately 54 minutes. Therefore, the bypass of the ARTS channels while above 45 percent reactor power is qualitatively evaluated as having very low safety significance. Page 3 of 5

ABSTRACT (   On June 16, 2016, the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station (DBNPS) was in Mode 1'and 100 percent reactor power. At 1137 hours, during review of industry operating experience, an issue was identified for the potential impact of low barometric pressure associated with a tornado on the Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs). The EDGs are equipped with a crankcase positive pressure trip with a set point of approximately 1 inch of water. It was determined that a design basis tornado could create sufficient low pressure to potentially actuate the crankcase positive pressure trip due to different vent paths between the EDG Room and the EDG crankcase. If the crankcase pressure trip occurs before the EDG starts on an emergency signal due to the tornado, the crankcase pressure trip would cause an EDG lockout. The EDG lockout would then prevent either an EDG normal or emergency start until operators could manually reset the lockout. This condition could potentially affect both EDGs simultaneously. This was an original EDG protective logic circuitry design issue that did not anticipate the interaction between the crankcase pressure trip and the outside atmospheric pressure.

ABSTRACT (   The two pressurizer safety valves (PSVs) at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station (DBNPS) were replaced during an outage in Spring, 2016 with tested spares. The removed PSVs were sent to an offsite vendor for testing and refurbishment. In June, 2016 the test results were received showing both PSVs lifted higher than the allowed one percent tolerance above the 2500 psig setpoint (2525 psig) for As-Found testing. Because both valves had As- Found setpoints above the Technical Specifications (TS) allowed value, a past operability evaluation was . performed, which concluded that both valves were inoperable during their time in service. Based on the as-found lift setting pressures (2559 psig and 2554 psig), there was no adverse effect on transients described in the Updated Safety Analysis Report that can produce a Reactor Coolant System (RCS) overpressurization. The cause of this event was due to setpoint drift and narrow allowable setpoint range. Procedures will be revised to establish more restrictive testing requirements. The PSVs were replaced and a TS change will be submitted to provide for current ASME acceptance test criteria for the PSV setpoint. This event is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B).
3462016008|1|CAUSE|1|The direct cause for the failure to properly apply TS 3.3.5 was determined to be that the Shift Manager failed to initially recognize that entry conditions for TS LCO 3.3.5 Condition B had been met following a loss of power to SFAS Channel 2. The TS was not reviewed in its entirety and provided peer checks were not performed independently. A contributing cause of the improper application of TS 3.3.5 was determined to be that station personnel failed to use or rigorously implement required processes and procedures involving the conduct of operations, event reporting, operability determination, and regulatory communications and interface. The root cause for the failure to properly apply TS 3.3.5 was determined to be that station management failed to recognize in a timely manner that a normalized deviation in organizational behaviors has occurred surrounding the accountability for.critical performance standards and expectations. Additionally, organizational biases such as maintaining an unrealistic optimism towards an outcome, technical arrogance, overconfidence in knowledge and expertise, and the failure to seek or respond effectively to challenges, have resulted in the tendency to rationalize behaviors. ANALYSIS The BWST Level Transmitters monitor the BWST Level and initiate an SFAS Level 5 signal on BWST Level -Low Low. This output signal provides a passive permissive interlock to allow operators the ability to shift ECCS suction from the BWST to the Emergency Sump by allowing operators to Open the Decay Heat Pump Suction From Emergency Sump Valves and close the associated BWST Isolation Valves. The transfer of suction source from the BWST to the Emergency Sump is a manual transfer. The Probabilistic Risk Analysis (PRA) models failure of the SFAS. Level 5 permissive signal, as well as failure of the valves to be repositioned (or failure of the human action to manually transfer the suction), which could result in the inability of the plant to shift ECCS suction from the BWST to the Emergency Sump. The four-channel SFAS system is a 2-out-of-four circuit, such that any two level instruments which sense a BWST Level — Low Low will actuate the permissive interlock for both trains. With both LT1525A and LT1525B out of service, the SFAS BWST Level — Low Low passive permissive transfer was active (i.e., the valves could be repositioned to shift from the BWST to the Emergency Sump) as indicated by Annunciator 5-3-A, BWST LO-LO LVL XFEREMER SUMP. Since the permissive interlock was met, a failure of this SFAS Level 5 permissive signal is not possible. Having the transfer permissive interlock active while the BWST was still full could permit operators to inadvertently transfer suction from the BWST to the Emergency Sump (violating procedure guidance) before there was adequate volume in the Emergency Sump. Additionally, having the transfer permissive annunciator 5-3-A lit significantly prior to reaching the BWST Level procedurally directing the transfer to the
3462016009|1|CAUSE|1|: The direct cause of the generator lockout and subsequent reactor trip was rain falling through an open roof vent onto the Turbine deck, which migrated into the AVR through one or more of the cabinet's conduit connections. The root causes of the generator lockout and reactor trip were (1) Operations Shift Managers did not advocate adequate and timely compensatory actions to eliminate the risk to generation posed by rain falling onto energized equipment through a stuck open Turbine Building roof vent, and (2) station management failed to recognize the roof vent rain issue as a potential imminent risk to generation. There are fourteen 4-foot by 8-foot smoke and heat vents in the Turbine Building roof, which are designed to automatically open at 165 degrees F due to a fusible link. Manual pull release handles also allow each vent to be opened without disturbing the fusible link. The roof vents had been routinely opened during warm weather to compensate for deficiencies in-the Turbine Building ventilation in order to reduce Turbine Building ambient temperatures. On August 14, 2016, it was identified that four of the roof vents could not be closed, including roof vent number 8 above the AVR. On the evening of August 17, 2016, operators noted water running from the Turbine deck (623 foot elevation) to the floor below (603 foot elevation) following a heavy rain storm due to roof vent 8.  being open. Maintenance personnel inspected the roof vents the following day to identify the necessary repairs, but no accelerated actions were taken beyond the normal work management process to repair the vents. Catch basins were installed below roof vent 8 on August 27, 2016, in attempt to collect the rain water to prevent it from affecting the equipment below. 1.
