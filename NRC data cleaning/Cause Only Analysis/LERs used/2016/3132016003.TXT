Background <br />In accordance with the Arkansas Nuclear One, Unit 1 (ANO-1), Safety Analysis Report (SAR), structures, systems, <br />and components (SSCs) important to safety should be designed to withstand the effects of natural phenomenon <br />such as tornados without loss of capability to perform the specified safety functions. In this respect, ANO-1 has <br />previously applied the guidance of Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.76, “Design Basis Tornado for Nuclear Power Plants” <br />(April 1974), with respect to the assumed tornado-induced wind speed of 300 miles per hour (mph). <br />Enforcement Guidance Memorandum (EGM) 15-002, “Enforcement Discretion for Tornado-Generated Missile <br />Protection Noncompliance,” provides guidance for exercising enforcement discretion when an operating power <br />reactor licensee does not comply with a plant’s current site-specific licensing basis for tornado-generated missile <br />protection. Specifically, enforcement discretion would apply to the applicable technical specification (TS) limiting <br />condition(s) for operation (LCO), which would require a reactor shutdown or mode change, if a licensee could not <br />complete TS LCO Required Action(s) within the stated TS Completion Time. <br />Interim Staff Guidance DSS-ISG-2016-01, “Clarification of Licensee Actions in Receipt of Enforcement Discretion <br />per Enforcement Guidance Memorandum EGM 15-002,” includes additional information intended to facilitate an <br />understanding of the expectations for consistent NRC oversight associated with implementing enforcement <br />discretion for tornado missile protection non-compliance(s) per EGM 15-002. <br />Appendix A to DSS-ISG-2016-01 includes guidance for acceptable initial and follow-up comprehensive <br />compensatory measures for licensee use in implementing the enforcement discretion outlined in EGM 15-002. The <br />licensee is expected to document (log) the utilization of EGM 15-002, inform the NRC resident inspector, and enter <br />the issue into the corrective action program. With respect to initial compensatory measures, it is expected that the <br />measures listed in Appendix A are already in place at sites that may be affected by severe weather, such as <br />tornadoes and/or hurricane force winds. The measures provided should be verified as current and readily <br />deployable within a very short timeframe (the shortest timeframe could, in some scenarios, be dictated by a TS <br />LCO 3.0.3 Completion Time of one hour). <br />B. Plant Status <br />At the stated dates/times the conditions were discovered, ANO-1 was operating in Mode 1 at 100% power. There <br />were no other structures, systems, or components (SSCs) that were inoperable at the time that contributed to the <br />event. <br />C. Event Description <br />ANO conducted walk downs and design verifications as extent of condition activities in response to compromised <br />external flood boundaries, which were previously identified at the station (reference LER 50-313/14-001-00, dated <br />May 5, 2014 (ML14125A483)). The extent of condition review was expanded to include other design vulnerabilities, <br />including those associated with tornado missile hazards. <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(04-2017) <br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />3.

Event Description (continued) <br />In June of 2016, a list of potential tornado missile protection vulnerabilities was developed to evaluate whether <br />differences between design documentation and actual plant configuration existed with respect to areas SSCs <br />important to safety that could be impacted by tornado missiles. On June 13, 2016, a tornado missile vulnerability <br />was identified for ANO-1 Door 77 (entrance to an electrical penetration room from the Turbine Building), which was <br />reported in LER 50-313/2016-002-00, dated August 11, 2016 (ML16224A767). <br />On August 24, 2016, a design vulnerability was identified for postulated tornado missiles entering the ANO-1 Cable <br />Spreading Room from the Turbine Building by penetrating the hollow metal door or potentially from spalling of the <br />block wall separating Rooms 96 and 97. A tornado could generate multiple missiles capable of striking the ANO-1 <br />Cable Spreading Room and rendering certain components on both safety related trains inoperable. <br />On September 11, 2016, a design vulnerability was identified for postulated tornado missiles entering the ANO-1 <br />Controlled Access area from the Turbine Building by penetrating block walls and hollow metal doors, and striking <br />safety related cables. A tornado could generate multiple missiles capable of striking components in this area and <br />rendering both safety related Emergency Feedwater (EFW) trains inoperable. <br />On September 15, 2016, a design vulnerability was identified for postulated tornado missiles entering ANO-1 <br />Rooms 99 and 100 from the Turbine Building and striking vital switchgear in the rooms. A tornado could generate <br />multiple missiles capable of striking vital ANO-1 electrical distribution equipment and rendering both safety related <br />AC electrical trains inoperable. <br />The aforementioned August 24, 2016, September 11, 2016, and September 15, 2016, vulnerabilities were reported <br />in LER 50-313/2016-003-00, dated October 19, 2016 (ML16293A664). <br />On April 17, 2017, a design vulnerability was identified for postulated tornado missiles entering ANO-1 Rooms 73 <br />and 104 from the Turbine Building and striking vital conduits and cable trays in the rooms. A tornado could generate <br />multiple missiles capable of striking vital ANO-1 electrical equipment and rendering certain components on both <br />safety-related trains inoperable. <br />Enforcement discretion per EGM 15-002 has been implemented for each of these identified issues and appropriate <br />compensatory actions taken. Each condition identified was entered into the ANO corrective action program. The <br />guidance provided in EGM 15-002, with reference to Appendix A of DSS-ISG-2016-01, was utilized to address the <br />TS operability aspects of these conditions. <br />D. Event Causes <br />The identified conditions are design legacy issues. The cause of this issue was unclear and changing regulatory <br />requirements during original plant licensing that led to an inadequate understanding of the regulatory guidance with <br />respect to tornado missile protection design requirements. <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(04-2017) <br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1022/r3/)  <br />1.

Corrective Actions <br />The following corrective actions were completed upon identification of each individual vulnerability: <br />• The ANO directive (COPD-038) for implementing the respective enforcement discretion was completed for <br />each identified condition. The actions completed ensure compliance with the requirements of EGM 15-002. <br />• The status of the affected TS components was documented in the Station Log. <br />• The NRC resident inspector and the ANO-1 Operating crews were briefed with respect to the equipment that <br />could be potentially affected during a site tornado event and the compensatory actions identified to both <br />minimize the potential for tornado missiles during severe weather and to mitigate the consequences of <br />potential tornado missiles. <br />The following corrective actions are being taken to further address these conditions: Note that EGM 15-002 requires <br />follow-up actions to be completed within 60 days following tornado vulnerability identification which resulted in <br />application of the enforcement discretion. These actions are in addition to those established upon initial <br />identification of a tornado missile vulnerability and intended to provide a discernable, safety beneficial change, when <br />compared with the initially established compensatory measures. <br />• Appropriate procedures and directives have been revised to address both the individual SSC impacts per area <br />identified and the aggregate impact of the tornado missile conditions (assuming all vulnerable areas were <br />equally impacted by a single tornado). The intent of this action is to provide a single location of information <br />where Operators can identify all potentially affected equipment and identify redundant or compensating safe <br />shutdown equipment which can minimize tornado effects. <br />• Short term plant changes are ongoing with the intent of minimizing the potential of tornado missile impacts with <br />respect to these vulnerable areas, while permanent modifications and licensing basis changes are being <br />evaluated and developed. For example, some non-grouted barriers (shield walls) are being filled in the interim, <br />effective in attenuating tornado missile velocity prior to target impingement. A permanent shield barrier is also <br />being prepared for installation at one potential tornado missile access point. <br />• Operations personnel remain abreast of the tornado missile vulnerabilities and the established compensatory <br />measures. Operations personnel are fully trained with respect to preparation for and the mitigation of natural <br />events such as tornados. Procedures currently available cover events such as natural emergencies (includes <br />tornado events), loss of offsite power, station blackout, and FLEX (diverse and flexible coping strategies) for <br />beyond design basis events, along with the aforementioned ANO directive (COPD-038). <br />Longer term corrective actions include development and installation of plant modifications which bring affected areas <br />into compliance with tornado missile protection standards as applicable to the ANO-1 licensing basis. Additional <br />options include the application of Revision 1 of RG 1.76, or the use of other evaluation methods such as the Tornado <br />Missile code (TORMIS) or the Tornado Missile Risk Evaluator (TMRE), either of which would require a license <br />amendment request and subsequent NRC approval. <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(04-2017) <br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />3.

If a means <br />used to impose an information collection does not display a currently valid OMB control number, the <br />NRC may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, the information <br />collection. <br />F. Safety Consequences: <br />ANO-1 is required to be protected from tornado generated missiles as applied within the unit’s design and licensing <br />basis. For the identified vulnerabilities, a tornado event of sufficient magnitude could challenge the operability and <br />availability of important instrumentation and redundant safety related equipment. The most significant potential <br />nuclear safety aspects that could be affected by a tornado that is assumed to produce multiple high-velocity missiles <br />is the loss of both EFW trains (utilized for post-trip decay heat removal), the loss of both Service Water loops, and <br />the loss of redundant AC power sources. <br />The regulation in 10 CFR 50.36(c)(2) outlines LCOs in the TSs. Certain TSs contain LCO statements that include <br />action statements (required actions and their associated completion time) to provide constraints on the length of time <br />components or systems may remain inoperable or out of service before the plant must be shut down or other <br />compensatory measures must be taken. Such time constraints are based on the safety significance of the <br />component or system being removed from service. <br />EGM 15-002, in providing the basis for granting the enforcement discretion states that, in general, tornado missile <br />scenarios that may lead to core damage are very low probability events because safety-related SSCs are typically <br />designed to withstand the effects of tornados. For a tornado missile induced scenario to occur, a tornado would <br />have to impact the site and result in the generation of missiles that would contact and fail vulnerable, unprotected <br />safety related equipment and/or unprotected safety related subcomponents in a manner that is not immediately <br />repairable or recoverable. In addition, because plants are designed with redundancy and diversity, the tornado <br />missiles would have to affect multiple trains of safety systems and/or means of achieving safe shutdown. <br />EGM-15-002 states that the NRC completed a generic risk analysis of potential tornado missile protection non <br />compliances to examine the risk significance of these scenarios. The generic nature of this analysis did not afford <br />the staff the capability to assess plant-specific tornado missile protections which likely exist at many reactors that <br />would result in lower risk determinations, and it did not consider the plant-specific nature of the non-compliances or <br />the redundancies of SSCs. The generic analysis assumed that core damage would occur if a tornado impacted a <br />plant located in the most active tornado region in the country, and a tornado-generated missile was generated which <br />results in the loss of all emergency core cooling equipment at the plant with no ability to recover. <br />Further, the study did not account for a number of conservatisms. For example, whereas the study assumed the <br />failure of redundant systems due to tornado-generated missiles, actual spatial configurations of redundant systems <br />at a plant could lower the probability of complete system failures as a result of tornado generated missiles. <br />Additionally, some tornado generated missiles may not cause system failures at all or may cause failures that are <br />repairable or recoverable within a reasonable time frame. <br />In summary, EGM 15-002 stated that the generic bounding risk analysis performed by the NRC concluded that this <br />issue is of low risk significance. Therefore, enforcement discretion until June 10, 2018, would not impose significant <br />additional risk to public health and safety. <br />This condition had no actual safety consequences impacting plant or public safety since ANO has not experienced a <br />tornado missile event. <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(04-2017) <br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />3.

Basis for Reportability: <br />This event is reportable pursuant to the following criteria: <br />10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B): Any event or condition that resulted in the nuclear plant being in an unanalyzed <br />condition that significantly degraded plant safety. <br />10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(A): Any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function <br />of structures or systems that are needed to shut down the reactor and maintain it in a <br />safe shutdown condition. <br />10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(B): Any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function <br />of structures or systems that are needed to remove residual heat. <br />10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D): Any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function <br />of structures or systems that are needed to mitigate the consequences of an <br />accident. <br />The guidance provided in NUREG 1022 states under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(1): <br />The holder of an operating license for a nuclear power plant (licensee) shall submit a Licensee Event Report <br />(LER) for any event of the type described in this paragraph within 60 days after the discovery of the event. <br />H. Additional Information: <br />10 CFR 50.73(b)(5) states that this report shall contain reference to “any previous similar events at the same plant <br />that are known to the licensee.” NUREG 1022 reporting guidance states that term “previous occurrences” should <br />include previous events or conditions that involved the same underlying concern or reason as this event, such as the <br />same root cause, failure, or sequence of events. <br />A review of the ANO corrective action program and LERs for the previous three years was performed. Aside from <br />LERs 50-313/2016-002-00 and 50-313/2016-003-00 mentioned previously, there were no other previous similar <br />events identified for ANO-1. A similar tornado missile vulnerability was identified on April 6, 2016, affecting the ANO, <br />Unit 2, #1 Emergency Diesel Generator, as reported in LER 50-368/2017-001-00. The conditions identified herein <br />were a result of extent of condition evaluations of plant SSCs with respect to potential tornado design vulnerabilities. <br />These vulnerabilities are legacy issues which are being addressed within the time frame allotted by EGM 15-002.<br /></span>
