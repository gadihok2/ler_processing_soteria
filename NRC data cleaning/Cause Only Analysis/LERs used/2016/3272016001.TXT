At the time of the event, Operations was warming the main steam (MS) line <br />downstream of the main steam isolations valves (MSIV) via the Loop 2 MSIV bypass valve. During this controlled <br />evolution, a sudden drop in MS line pressure occurred that actuated the two-out-of-three logic as sensed on all three Loop <br />2 steam line pressure bi-stables. All safety systems responded as designed and the SI was terminated per procedure. <br />Prior to the event, Unit 1 was recovering from a forced outage involving a Main Generator Blower repair that began on <br />December 26, 2016. Unit 1 was maintained in Mode 3 during this time. The most probable cause of the SI actuation was <br />determined to be water accumulation in MS Loop 2 upstream of the MSIV as a result of steam condensation not being <br />drained during the extended Mode 3 forced outage. <br />Troubleshooting was initiated and Unit 1 was placed in Mode 4 to facilitate draining of Loop 2 and 3 MS lines. Corrective <br />actions include actions to address operating for extended periods of time in Mode 4 and above with MSIVs closed. <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />1. FACILITY NAME 2.

Plant Operating Conditions Before the Event <br />At the time of the event, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Unit 1 reactor was in Mode 3 due to a forced <br />outage involving the Main Generator. No inoperable systems, structures, or components contributed <br />to this event. <br />II. Description of Events <br />A. Event: <br />On February 9, 2016 at 1415 Eastern Standard Time (EST), SQN Unit 1 experienced an <br />automatic Low Steam Line Pressure Safety Injection (SI) [EIIS Code BQ] signal. The SI resulted <br />in actuation of both trains of Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) [EIIS Codes BQ/BP] and <br />injection into the Reactor Coolant System (RCS) [EIIS Code AB]. <br />Just prior to the event, Operations was preparing to warm the main steam (MS) [EIIS code SB] <br />lines downstream of the main steam isolation valves (MSIV) [EIIS Code ISV] in accordance with <br />System Operating Instructions. The System Operating Instruction allows for MS line warming <br />using up to three MSIV bypass valves based on the RCS temperature. SQN Unit 1 was in <br />Mode 3 with two reactor coolant pumps (RCPs) [EIIS Code P] in service and RCS temperature <br />and pressure at 524 degrees Fahrenheit (F) and 2235 pound per square inch gauge (psig), <br />respectively. The Loop 2 MSIV bypass valve was selected to conduct the MS line warming <br />because it had a running RCP, and the steam pressure trends noted during MSIV bypass valve <br />operability testing provided confidence that RCS temperature and steam generator (SG) [EIIS <br />Code SG] pressure would be adequately controlled. Operations briefed a contingency to close <br />the Loop 2 MSIV bypass valve if plant conditions were not as expected. <br />At approximately 1413 EST, the Loop 2 MSIV bypass valve was opened. The pressure drop in <br />MS Loop 2 was approximately 10 to 12 psig per minute. At-1415 EST, a sudden pressure drop <br />in MS Loop 2 occurred at approximately 50 psig per second and the automatic SI signal initiated. <br />All three MS Loop 2 pressure bi-stables that feed the protective sets actuated up within <br />20 milliseconds of each other making up the two-out-of-three logic. All safety systems <br />responded as designed and the SI was terminated per procedure. <br />During the warming of MS Loop 2, the water was transferred to piping downstream of the MSIV <br />via the 2-inch MSIV bypass line. Once the vertical sections of piping were void of water, the <br />horizontal sections began emptying and opened a flow path for steam to move into the vertical <br />sections of piping resulting in a steam pressure drop in the Loop 2 SG. Ultrasonic water level <br />measurements identified the MS Loop 2 36-inch horizontal line contained about 18 inches of <br />Page 2 of 7 <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />1. FACILITY NAME 6.

The 36-inch MS Loop 3 horizontal line was determined to have approximately 14 inches <br />of water. <br />Plans were developed and initiated to drain the water from the affected MS lines. Unit 1 was <br />placed in Mode 4 to facilitate draining. All work was completed as planned. <br />The event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), as an event that resulted <br />in a manual or automatic actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS), the Auxiliary <br />Feedwater System (AFW) [EIIS Code BA] , and the ECCS. <br />By design, following the SI signal, both Emergency Gas Treatment System,(EGTS) [EllS Code <br />BH] air cleanup subsystem trains aligned to support Unit 1. This action caused both trains of the <br />EGTS air cleanup subsystem to be inoperable for Unit 2 on February 9, 2016, from 1416 EST <br />until 1602 EST, when the EGTS was restored per procedure. <br />B. Status of structures, components, or systems that were inoperable at the start of the event <br />and contributed to the event: <br />There were no inoperable structures, components, or systems that contributed to this <br />event. <br />C. Dates and approximate times of occurrences: <br />On February 9, 2016, at 1412 EST, operators commenced warming of the Unit 1 MS <br />header using the loop 2 MSIV bypass valve.

Other systems or secondary functions affected: <br />Because the centrifugal charging pumps (CCP) [EIIS Code BQ] injected into the RCS loops <br />during the event, the Pressurizer (PZR) [EIIS Code PZR] level increased and then decreased, <br />which is indicative of a PZR insurge followed by a rapid heatup of PZR liquid and an outsurge. <br />The PZR water temperature decreased from 662 degrees F to 544 degrees F and then <br />increased back to 663 degrees F. SQN's Technical Requirements Manual (TRM) limits changes <br />to the PZR temperature to a maximum heatup of 100 degrees F and a maximum cool down of <br />200 degrees F in any one hour period. As a result, an evaluation was conducted to analyze <br />,thermal fatigue induced damage to the PZR Lower Head and Surge Line Nozzle. <br />The PZR insurge and outsurge did cause a small increase in fatigue usage of the PZR Lower <br />Head and Surge Line Nozzle. The increase has been demonstrated to be well within available <br />fatigue margins. <br />F. Method of discovery of each component or system failure or procedural error: <br />Control Room alarms annunciated alerting operators to the start of the event. <br />G. The failure mode, mechanism, and effect of each failed component, if known: <br />No failure occurred. <br />H. Operator actions: <br />The operators entered Emergency Procedure E-0, Reactor Trip or Safety Injections and <br />transitioned to ES-1.1, SI Termination. No human performance issues were identified. <br />I. Automatically and manually initiated safety system responses: <br />Following the automatic SI actuation, all plant systems responded as designed. The <br />following automatic responses occurred: Phase A Containment Isolation, Containment <br />Ventilation Isolation, Control Room Isolation and Auxiliary Building Isolation. All four <br />emergency diesel generators [EllS Code EK] started and operated in standby mode without <br />tying to the engineered safety feature boards [EIIS Code EB]. All control rods were <br />previously inserted as part of the controlled shutdown and the reactor trip breakers were <br />open. <br />III. Cause of the event <br />A. 	 The cause of each component or system failure or personnel error, if known: <br />The most probable cause of the automatic SI actuation was determined to be water <br />accumulation in MS Loop 2 as a result of steam condensation not being drained during the <br />extended Mode 3 forced outage. <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />1.

Specifically, a process to evaluate the accumulation of water upstream of the <br />MSIVs was not considered. An effective use of operating experience, prior to entering <br />the period of extended Mode 3 operation was not used. <br />B. 	 The cause(s) and circumstances for each human performance related root cause: <br />No human performance issues were identified. <br />The cause analysis is documented in Condition Report 1135308. <br />IV. 	 Analysis of the event: <br />Prior to the automatic SI event, SQN Unit 1 was in Mode 3 for the previous 45 days. The Updated <br />Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) event most similar to this event is the Spurious SI at Power <br />Event from 102 percent of 3423 megawatts (MW) thermal RTP (Rated Thermal Power). In the <br />UFSAR analysis, the reactor trips with the SI, or it can be tripped by the RPS. It is assumed that the <br />reactor trip occurs due to low pressurizer pressure. During the event described in this LER, the PZR <br />pressure was maintained well over the SI setpoint and remained within the UFSAR analysis. <br />There was no transient for reactor power. A reactor trip signal was generated, but the reactor trip <br />breakers were already open. Prior to the event, RCS pressure was approximately 2235 psig. <br />Following SI, RCS pressure increased to around 2250 psig, decreased to around 2220 psig, then <br />increased to around 2278 psig. The RCS temperature averaged about 527 degrees F prior to the <br />event. The lowering steam pressure, the influx of cold AFW generated by the SI, and the CCP <br />injection tank (CCPIT) injection into the RCS reduced the RCS temperature by 10-12 degrees in <br />approximately 5 minutes. PZR level was on program at approximately 25 percent at the time of the <br />SI. As the RCS temperature experienced no immediate reduction following the SI, the PZR level <br />increased due to the influx of water via the CCPIT and the letdown isolation. The PZR level had <br />reached 50 percent at the time the SI was terminated and the CCPIT flow isolated. The PZR level <br />continued to rise until excess letdown was established. The peak PZR level was 65 percent. In the <br />UFSAR analysis, the PZR would approach 100 percent level. Two RCPs were in service at all times <br />during the transient and forced flow was maintained with no anomalies noted. Containment pressure <br />and temperature were unaffected by this transient. Radiation levels following the unit trip were within <br />expected post trip values. The non-response of these indicators is consistent with a leak-tight RCS <br />and no transient induced fuel failures. <br />The RCS bulk temperature change was small in scope. There was no challenge to the Technical <br />Specification (TS) 3.4.3, "RCS Pressure and Temperature (PIT) Limits." The actual PZR heatup <br />during the SI event was 119 degrees F in approximately 55 minutes, which violated Technical <br />Requirement 8.4.2. The pressure remained within TS limits and bounded by the UFSAR analysis. <br />While this transient caused a small increase in the total fatigue usage of the lower pressurizer and <br />surge line, these components remain well within design basis fatigue limits. <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />1.

The turbine driven AFW pump did start. The AFW flow on all four loops increased <br />rapidly to the maximum flow rate at the time of the SI signal, consistent with all of the AFW level <br />control valves fully opening as designed. The Operators decreased the AFW flow rate to a low value <br />within 4 minutes of the SI signal. Main feedwater [EIIS Code SJ] was already isolated at the time of <br />the event. The MSIVs were closed prior to and during the event. The relatively small RCS <br />temperature change had little effect on the SG water level. <br />The plant responded as expected for the conditions of the event. Plant response remained within TS <br />limits and was bounded by the UFSAR analysis during this event. <br />V. 	 Assessment of Safety Consequences <br />There were no safety consequences as a result of the event. All safety systems functioned as <br />designed. No TS limits were exceeded and the event was bounded by the UFSAR. <br />A. Availability of systems or components that could have performed the same function as the <br />components and systems that failed during the event: <br />No systems or components failed as a result of the SI actuation. <br />B. For events that occurred when the reactor was shut down, availability of systems or <br />components needed to shutdown the reactor and maintain safe shutdown conditions, <br />remove residual heat, control the release of radioactive material, or mitigate the <br />consequences of an accident: <br />The event occurred with Unit 1 in Mode 3. With Unit 1 reactor shutdown, the systems and <br />components needed to maintain safe shutdown conditions and remove residual heat, <br />control the release of radioactive material or mitigate the consequences of an accident <br />were not affected. <br />C. For failure that rendered a train of a safety system inoperable, an estimate of the elapsed <br />time from discovery of the failure until the train was returned to service: <br />There was no failure that rendered a train of a safety system inoperable. <br />VI. 	 Corrective Actions <br />Corrective Actions are being managed by TVA's corrective action program under Condition <br />Report 1135308'. <br />A.
