On <br />February 16, 2016 at 0631 EST, during surface preparation work, axial indications were found on the WOL. Evaluation of <br />the indications found in the weld overlay suggests that the non-satisfactory PT examination was a result of the propagation <br />of the original flaw that was found on the 1 E Recirculation Loop Piping. The original indication had propagated into the <br />Incoiiel Alloy 82 WOL material installed in 1988. It was determined that the as-found condition of the flaw did not meet <br />ASME Section XI acceptance criteria. The indications were removed from the WOL and 1B31-E5 was upgraded to a full <br />structural weld overlay using intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IGCSS) resistant Alloy 52 weld material. <br />NRC FORM 366 (02-20151 <br />1.

Hatch Nuclear Plant Unit 1 05000 321 2 OF 3 <br />YEAR SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />REV. <br />NO. <br />2016 -- 003 -- 00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />PLANT AND SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION <br />General Electric- Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) <br />Energy Industry Identification System codes appear in the text as (EIIS Code XX) <br />DESCRIPTION OF EVENT <br />On February 16, 2016 at 0631 EST, with Unit 1 at 0 percent rated thermal power due to a scheduled refueling outage, it <br />was discovered that an axial flaw found on the recirculation inlet nozzle 1B31-1RC-12BR-E-5 (1631-E5) to safe-end <br />weldment had propagated into the Inconel Alloy 82 Weld Overlay (WOL) material installed in 1988. Evaluation of the as-<br />found condition of the flaw did not meet ASME Section XI acceptance criteria. <br />As part of normal pre-outage scope activities, plans were put in place to upgrade the 11331-E5 partial WOL to a FSWOL in <br />order to allow for code qualified examinations. During surface preparation work, axial indications were found on the partial <br />WOL. It was then discovered that the original flaw had propagated into the Inconel Alloy 82 WOL material installed in 1988. <br />The flaw was repaired in accordance with an approved code alternative and 1631-E5 was upgraded to a full structural <br />weld overlay (FSWOL) using intergranular stress corrosion cracking resistant Alloy 52 weld material. <br />CAUSE OF EVENT <br />The unacceptable as-found condition of the defect found in the WOL for 1631-E5 was due to intergranular stress corrosion <br />cracking (IGSCC). The 304 stainless steel piping and Inconel Alloy 182 weld materials are susceptible to this failure mode <br />in a BWR environment. <br />The station also lost track of the different design attributes of 1631-E5 weld repair. This led to mis-characterization of the <br />weld as a FSWOL and extending the exam frequency, thus causing the station to not adequately monitor the growth of the <br />flaw. Reliefs that reduced the frequency of performance of ISI code exams were approved by the NRC. Approval was <br />based upon the ASME Class 1 WOL's meeting the requirements of being a full structural WOL type. Additionally, during <br />the implementation of BWRVIP-075, a risk classification was required to prioritize the welds to be examined. However, the <br />assumption that all Unit 1 WOL repairs were full structural welds affected the priority placed upon this weld. The flaw was <br />repaired in accordance with an approved code alternative and 1B31-E5 was upgraded to a full structural weld overlay <br />(FSWOL) using intergranular stress corrosion cracking resistant Alloy 52 weld material. <br />NRC FORM 366A (1-2001) <br />NRC FORM 366A (02-2014) <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(02.2014) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />1. FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET 6. LER NUMBER 3. PAGE <br />YEAR SEQUENTIAL REV. <br />Edwin I. Hatch Nuclear Plant Unit 1 05000 321 <br />NUMBER NO. 3 OF 3 <br />2016 — 003 — 00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />REPORT ABILITY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT <br />This event is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A) due to a defect in the primary coolant system that could not be <br />found acceptable under ASME Section XI. Upon performance of the subsequent liquid penetrant testing (PT) <br />examination, it was discovered that the as-found condition of the flaw did not meet ASME Section XI acceptance criteria. <br />Evaluation of the flaw found in the weld overlay suggests that the non-satisfactory PT examination is a result of the <br />propagation of the original flaw that was found on the 1 E Recirculation Loop Piping. <br />Though the weld flaw exceeded the acceptance criteria of ASME Section XI, no leakage from this flaw was identified at <br />any time during operation or shutdown. There is reasonable assurance that there was not a breach in the credited RCS <br />boundary due to the axial flaw not having grown through the weld overlay. Additionally, engineering evaluation of the <br />structural integrity of the weld shows that the flawed component had adequate margin for all design basis events. The <br />evaluation has shown that the axial flaw identified in Weld 1B31-1RC-12BR-E-5 located on the recirculation inlet system, <br />meets the ASME Code, Section XI structural margin, considering a Service Level D structural factor in the evaluation, as <br />required by the NRC Inspection Manual. Even though the flaw has a depth of 100% of original wall thickness, which <br />exceeds the ASME Code, Section XI allowable flaw depth of 75% of wall thickness, the safety of the reactor pressure <br />boundary was not compromised. It is, therefore, concluded that the flawed component had adequate margin for all <br />Design Basis Loading Events when the flaw was identified and this condition had a very low safety significance. <br />CORRECTIVE ACTIONS <br />As part of corrective actions, a weld repair on 11331-1RC-12BR-E-5 was completed to restore piping back to original <br />code. The design type weld overlay was upgraded to a full structural weld overlay using Inconel Alloy 52 weld material in <br />accordance with an NRC approved alternative (HNP-ISI-ALT-15-01). <br />As part of an extent of condition review, a similar weld repair was performed on 1631-1RC-12BR-C-5 to upgrade its weld <br />from a design type weld overlay to a full structural weld overlay. Also, Unit 1 and 2 weld overlays containing Alloy 82 <br />weld material will be re-examined in the upcoming refueling outages. <br />ADDITIONAL INFORMATION  <br />Other Systems Affected: No systems other than those mentioned in this report were affected by this event. <br />Failed Components Information: None. <br />Commitment Information: This report does not created any new licensing commitments. <br />Previous Similar Events: None. <br />NRC FORM 388A (1-2001) <br />NRC FORM 388A (02-2014)<br /></span>
