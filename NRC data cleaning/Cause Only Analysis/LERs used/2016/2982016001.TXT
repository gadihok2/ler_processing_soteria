A non-licensed <br />operator was dispatched to the HPCI ALOP starter and reported that the local indication lights were not illuminated. <br />HPCI was declared inoperable at 2117 Central Daylight Time (CDT) resulting in entry into Technical Specifications <br />(TS) Limiting Condition of Operation 3.5.1, Condition C, HPCI System Inoperable. <br />Investigation determined that the coil in the electrical relay for the ALOP, which had recently been replaced during a <br />preventive maintenance window, had failed after 133 hours of service. The cause of the failure was determined to be <br />the prior pre-installation checks performed by NuTherm on the relay were inadequate to prevent the type of infant <br />mortality failure that occurred in this case. HPCI was declared operable at 1314 CDT on April 26, 2016, after the coil <br />was replaced. <br />This event is being reported as a loss of safety function due to HPCI being a single-train safety system, as a condition <br />prohibited by TS and in accordance with 10 CFR Part 21. <br />The potential safety consequences of this event were minimal due to both the limited duration the condition existed <br />and the redundant/diverse core cooling systems which remained operable. <br />NRC FORM 366 (04-2017) <br />NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(04-2017) <br />.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LER NUMBER <br />YEAR SEQUENTIAL REV <br />Cooper Nuclear Station 05000- 	 298 NUMBER NO. <br />2016 -001 -02 <br />NARRATIVE <br />PLANT STATUS <br />Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS) was in Mode 1, Power Operation, at 100 percent steady state power at the <br />time the condition was identified. Service Water Pump "B" and Service Water Booster Pump "B" were <br />inoperable when High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) was inoperable. No other emergency core <br />cooling systems were inoperable during the event. <br />BACKGROUND <br />The HPCI System (El IS:BJ) provides protection to the core for the case of a small break in the reactor <br />coolant pressure boundary which does not result in rapid depressurization of the reactor vessel <br />(EIIS:RPV). The HPCI System permits the nuclear plant to be shutdown while maintaining sufficient <br />reactor vessel water inventory until the reactor vessel is depressurized. The HPCI System continues to <br />operate until reactor vessel pressure is below the pressure at which Low Pressure Coolant Injection <br />(EIIS:BO) operation or Core Spray System (EllS:BM) operation can be used to maintain core cooling. <br />HPCI consists of a steam turbine assembly (El IS:TRB) driving a multi-stage booster and main pump <br />assembly (EIIS:P) and system piping, valves, controls and instrumentation. The HPCI turbine is driven <br />by steam from the reactor which is generated by decay and residual heat. <br />A control governor (EIIS:65) receives a HPCI flow signal and adjusts the turbine steam control valve <br />(El IS:SCV) so that HPCI design pump discharge flow rate is obtained. The flow signal used for <br />automatic control of the HPCI turbine is derived from a differential pressure measurement across a flow <br />element (EIIS:FE) in the HPCI pump discharge pipeline. The governor controls the pressure applied to <br />the hydraulic operator of the turbine control valve, which, in turn, controls the steam flow to the HPCI <br />turbine. <br />Upon receipt of the actuation signal, the auxiliary oil pump starts, providing hydraulic pressure for the <br />turbine stop valve and turbine control valve hydraulic operator. The flow signal will ramp the control <br />governor until rated flow is achieved. As hydraulic oil pressure is developed, the turbine stop valve and <br />the turbine control valve open simultaneously and the turbine accelerates toward the speed setting of the <br />control governor. As HPCI flow increases, the flow signal adjusts the control governor setting so that <br />design flow is maintained. <br />EVENT DESCRIPTION <br />On April 25, 2016, while performing a walkdown of Control Room panels, a licensed operator noticed that <br />the green indication light for the HPCI auxiliary lube oil pump (ALOP) was not illuminated. The bulb in the <br />Control Room panel was replaced, but did not illuminate. A non-licensed station operator was <br />subsequently sent to the HPCI ALOP starter to verify local indications and found the local indication lights <br />were not illuminated on the starter rack, indicating that the ALOP starter had lost power. The ALOP is <br />required to start in order to open the steam admission valves for the HPCI turbine. An attempt was made <br />in the Control Room to start the ALOP, but it did not start. <br />NRC FORM 366A (04-2017) 	 Page 2 of 5 <br />NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY <br />COMMISSION <br />(04-2017) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R 3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1022/r3/)  <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 03/31/2020 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 <br />hours.

The relay is expected to provide three years of reliable service between replacements. <br />As such, it was concluded that the coil had sustained an infant mortality type failure. <br />The dedication process used by the vendor of the relay, NuTherm, at the time the relay was purchased <br />by CNS, consisted of verifying the pickup and dropout voltages, and verifying contact resistances. After <br />purchase of the relay, but prior to installation, NuTherm revised their dedication process to require <br />additionally cycling the relay 30 times in addition to the previous voltage and resistance checks. <br />The relay that failed was replaced with a new relay that was purchased in September 2013 from a <br />different lot than the failed relay purchased in March 2011. After satisfactory completion of post work <br />testing of the ALOP, HPCI was declared operable at 1314 CDT on April 26, 2016. <br />BASIS FOR REPORT <br />The HPCI System is a single train safety system. This condition is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR <br />50.73(a)(2)(v) as "any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function <br />of structures or systems that are needed to...(D) Mitigate the consequences of an accident." The <br />condition is also reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by TS <br />since, due to HPCI inoperability, the verification of the Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) system <br />operability exceeded the 1 hour required completion time plus the 12 hour completion time to be in Mode <br />3 if this verification is not completed. RCIC was verified operable by administrative means concurrent <br />with the HPCI inoperability declaration as reported in Event Notification Number 51882. <br />10 CFR PART 21 REPORT <br />Name and address of the individual (or individuals) informing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission: <br />John Dent, Vice President-Nuclear and Chief Nuclear Officer <br />Cooper Nuclear Station <br />72676 648A Avenue <br />Brownville, NE 68321 <br />The facility the dedication plan and basic component was supplied for which contained a defect: <br />Cooper Nuclear Station <br />72676 648A Avenue <br />Brownville, NE 68321 <br />The basic component is: Allen-Bradley DC control relay, model number 700DC-P220Z2 and <br />NuTherm Dedication Package 141-DD-01. <br />NRC FORM 366A (04-2017) <br />	 Page 3 of 5 <br />NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY <br />COMMISSION <br />(04-2017) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />• CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R 3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.goldreading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staffisr10221r31)  <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 03131/2020 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 <br />hours.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LER NUMBER <br />YEAR SEQUENTIAL REV <br />Cooper Nuclear Station 05000- 298 NUMBER NO. <br />2016 - 001 -02 <br />NARRATIVE <br />The firm supplying the dedication plan and basic component which contained a defect is: <br />NuTherm International, Inc. <br />501 South 11th Street <br />Mount Vernon, IL 62864 <br />The cause of the condition is an inadequate pre-installation test plan and defect of an Allen-Bradley <br />control relay in a NuTherm starter. The relay failure appeared to be a fault caused by a manufacturing <br />flaw that likely occurred due to a tensioning issue at the start of the coil wire winding process. The <br />dedication plan for the Allen-Bradley control relay was inadequate to identify the defect in the relay. The <br />failed starter was associated with the HPCI auxiliary lube oil pump causing the HPCI system to be <br />inoperable. The relay model is used in numerous other HPCI starters and in the reactor recirculation <br />pump discharge valve starters. The dedication plan is specific to the Allen-Bradley DC control relay, <br />model number 700DC-P220Z2; therefore, the population affected is the same as that of the relay <br />installation listed below. A review of the adequacy of other NuTherm dedication plans to identify a <br />similar condition has been completed. The results of this review revealed one other applicable relay <br />purchased from NuTherm. The dedication for this relay performed more thorough testing on the coil <br />than the dedication for the relay that failed, and provides reasonable assurance that the relay will <br />perform its intended safety function. In addition, the CNS material's purchase order requirements were <br />revised to ensure future procurements include the enhancements of additional cycling of the relay and <br />the performance of dielectric strength testing on the relay coil. The loss of HPCI as a single train system <br />is considered a substantial safety hazard, as defined by 10 CFR Part 21. <br />The date on which the information of a defect was obtained was August 28, 2017. A Part 21 <br />assessment was completed on this date that determined the deviation constituted a defect in accordance <br />with regulatory definitions. The initial 10 CFR Part 21 report was completed on August 28, 2017, in <br />Event Notification Number 52934. <br />There were ten relays of that model installed in the plant, located in the following starters: <br />CNS-2-EE-STR-250HPCI ALOP (HPCI Auxiliary Lube Oil Pump) <br />CNS-2-EE-STR-250HPCI CP (HPCI Condensate Pump) <br />CNS-2-EE-STR-250HPCI GSE (HPCI Gland Seal Exhauster) <br />CNS-2-EE-STR-250HPCI M014 (HPCI Turbine Steam Inlet Valve) <br />CNS-2-EE-STR-250HPCI M019 (HPCI Injection Valve) <br />CNS-2-EE-STR-250HPCI M020 (HPCI Injection Valve) <br />CNS-2-EE-STR-250HPCI M021 (HPCI Test Line Valve) <br />CNS-2-EE-STR-250HPCI M025 (HPCI Minimum Flow Valve) <br />CNS-1-EE-STR-250DIV1 M053A (Recirculation Pump "A" Discharge Valve) <br />CNS-2-EE-STR-250DIV2 M053B (Recirculation Pump "B" Discharge Valve) <br />NRC FORM 366A (04-2017) <br />	 Page 4 of 5 <br />(See NUREG-1022, R 3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1022/r3/) <br /> <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 03/31/2020 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 <br />hours.

LER NUMBER <br />YEAR SEQUENTIAL REV <br />Cooper Nuclear Station 05000- 	 298 NUMBER NO. <br />2016 - 001 -02 <br />NARRATIVE <br />The failed relay was replaced with a relay from a different batch by CNS maintenance on April 26, 2016. <br />NuTherm revised their dedication process such that this type of failure will be detected. This action was <br />completed on May 13, 2016. In addition, current pre-installation checks were reviewed to determine <br />what is necessary to reasonably ensure that infant mortality failures are minimized. This action was <br />completed by the CNS Design Engineering Department on May 25, 2016. <br />There is no advice related to the defect or failure to comply about the facility, activity or basic component <br />that has been, is being, or will be given, to purchasers or licensees. <br />This event does not involve an early site permit. <br />SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE <br />This is a Safety System Functional Failure. There were no actual safety consequences associated with <br />this event. The potential safety consequences of this event were minimal due to the limited duration the <br />condition existed and the redundant/diverse core cooling systems which remained operable throughout <br />the event. The HPCI system is an emergency core cooling system designed to inject water into the <br />reactor vessel to provide core cooling. The total duration of inoperability, including the time prior to <br />discovery of the condition was less than the 14 day Technical Specification Completion Time. During the <br />time period of inoperability, other core cooling systems (Automatic Depressurization System, Core <br />Spray, and Low Pressure Coolant Injection) were operable and would have adequately responded to a <br />design basis event. The Reactor Core Isolation Cooling system was also operable during this event. <br />CAUSE <br />The root cause of the event was determined to be that the prior pre-installation checks performed by <br />NuTherm on the relay were inadequate to prevent the infant mortality failure that occurred in this case. <br />CORRECTIVE ACTIONS <br />NuTherm revised their dedication process such that this type of failure will be detected. In addition, <br />there are no relays from this lot in storage at CNS; however a check of maintenance records found that <br />some of the relays from this lot are installed in the plant. These installed relays are well beyond the <br />infant mortality period and have performed as expected. <br />PREVIOUS EVENTS <br />There have been no events reported in the last three years related to the HPCI ALOP. <br />NRC FORM 366A (04-2017) <br />	 Page 5 of 5<br /></span>
