The penetrations are located in the floor of Turbine <br />Building elevation 354 ft. Below the penetrations is the Auxiliary Building, housing safety related equipment. <br />On March 17, 2016, it was identified that two penetration seals did not match approved fire penetration or approved <br />flood seal details. Further investigation, completed on March 19, 2016, revealed that the two block-out penetrations <br />were not grouted and represented a previously unknown vulnerability in a credited external flood barrier. <br />The apparent cause of this event was less than adequate project management control for the size and scope of the <br />External Flood Mitigation Project associated with post Fukushima Dai-ichi resolutions and requirements set forth by the <br />NRC. <br />Mitigating strategies and extent of condition reviews have been implemented for the identified conditions. Permanent <br />repair of the deficient flood barriers is complete minus cure time. Actions to correct programmatic aspects of this <br />condition are in progress. <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />1. FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3.

Background <br />The design basis flood protection elevation for Arkansas Nuclear One, Units 1 and 2 (ANO-1 and ANO- 2) safety-<br />related components and structures is 361 ft. Mean Sea Level (MSL). The design basis flood is a combination of the <br />probable maximum flood (PMF) (358 ft. MSL), which is based on a 10,000 year probability, and the assumed <br />coincident failure of the upstream Ozark Dam (+3 ft.). The ANO-1 and ANO-2 Safety Analysis Reports (SARs) state <br />that Seismic Class/Category 1 structures are designed for the PMF of 361 ft. MSL and Seismic Class/Category 1 <br />systems and equipment are either located on floors above 361 ft. MSL or protected by walls, waterproof doors, <br />hatches, etc. <br />B. Plant Status <br />At the time the condition was discovered, ANO-1 and ANO-2 were operating in Mode 1 at 100% power. There were no <br />other structures, systems, or components that were inoperable at the time that contributed to the event. <br />C. Event Description <br />ANO conducted walk downs and design verifications as follow-up activities in response to Near-Term Task Force <br />(NTTF) Recommendation 2.3, "Flooding Walk down of the NTTF Review of Insights from the Fukushima Dai-ichi <br />Accident." As previously reported in LER 50-313/2014-01-00 dated May 5, 2014, multiple instances of ANO-1 and <br />ANO-2 design features that may not have provided adequate external flood protection for safety-related equipment <br />located below the design basis flood elevation of 361 ft. MSL were documented during these walk downs. Examples <br />of the identified deficient design features and procedures included: <br />• Missing or deficient internal conduit seals <br />• Missing or deficient seals <br />• Unsealed removable closure plates <br />• Missing gaskets <br />• Roof leaks <br />• Ground water intrusion through penetrations, building joints and conduits <br />• Degraded hatch gaskets <br />• Floor drain system cross connected between flood protected areas and non-flood areas <br />Due to the lack of designed isolation features on these pathways, the potential existed for flood waters to migrate into <br />the Auxiliary Building where pumps and equipment required for safe shutdown are located. <br />In March 2016, as part of follow-up actions, a list of dual-function penetrations (fire and flood) was being created to <br />determine where there was a detail difference between the Fire Penetration Log and the Flood Features database. <br />Penetrations 00073-01-0034 and 0073-01-0063 were identified on the Fire Penetration Log as sealed with lathe and <br />plaster; however, the Flood Features database indicated the penetrations were sealed with grout and/or cellular <br />concrete. Lathe and plaster is sufficient for fire protection purposes, but unqualified for flood protection. This was <br />documented in Condition Report CR-ANO-1-2016-0985 on March 17, 2016. No recent documentation could be <br />located supporting the assertion that the penetrations were sealed with grout and/or cellular concrete. Follow-up field <br />inspection confirmed the penetrations were sealed with lathe and plaster and the penetrations were declared non-<br />functional for flood protection on March 19, 2016. <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />(See Page 2 for required number of <br />digits/characters for each block) <br />NRC FORM 366 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />Page 2 of 5 <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />1.

Event Causes <br />The direct cause of the event (failure to identify the lathe and plaster detail in two flood barrier block-out penetrations) <br />is both the vendor preparer and reviewer failed to perform adequate verification of penetration details in drawings and <br />the associated Flood Features database. <br />The apparent cause of this event is less than adequate project management control for the size and scope of the <br />External Flood Mitigation Project. <br />The following contributing causes were also identified: <br />• Oversight personnel did not recognize and correct inadequate monitoring and management of the project as <br />the scope and complexity increased. <br />• Flood design documents did not distinguish between lathe and plaster from grout, other than in the Fire <br />Penetration Log, which was not accessible in the field. <br />• The preparer and reviewer did not follow design verification requirements. Penetration photographs were <br />accepted as sufficient information for assigning incorrect details on architectural drawings and in the Flood <br />Features database for the two block-out penetrations. <br />E. 	 Corrective Actions <br />The following corrective actions have been completed to address this condition: <br />• Carbon steel forms were anchored to the floor around the subject block-out penetrations and sealing <br />materials staged as a contingency until permanent repairs can be completed. <br />• A comprehensive review of the Flood Features database, Fire Protection Penetration Log, and architectural <br />drawings has been performed. No further external flooding vulnerabilities were identified during this review. <br />• A human performance error review has been completed to document inappropriate action analysis. <br />The following corrective actions are being taken to further address this condition (list is not all inclusive): <br />• Entergy personnel and contractors responsible for gaps in oversight and accountability related to the external <br />flooding project will be briefed on the importance of recognition and mitigation of the impacts of schedule <br />pressures and changes in personnel assigned to the project. <br />• A detailed review of the vendor's root cause evaluation being developed will be performed and important <br />results and actions from the review will be documented in the ANO corrective action plan. <br />• A review of completed external flood barrier walk-down packages is planned to determine if post verification <br />entries in the walk-down package have been made without verification and to document the adequacy of all <br />external flood boundary features (including vendor test data, qualification reports and other supporting <br />documentation). <br />• Permanent repair of the defective block-out penetrations. <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />(See Page 2 for required number of <br />digits/characters for each block) <br />NRC FORM 366 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />Page 3 of 5 <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />1.

Safety Significance Evaluation <br />Arkansas Nuclear One is required to be protected from flooding within the station's design and licensing basis. The <br />safety-related equipment required to mitigate the consequences of an accident were potentially affected by this <br />condition. There are several factors which could mitigate the impact of these deficiencies depending on the specific <br />conditions encountered during an actual event including the actual flood height, the capability for the subject block-out <br />penetrations to resist water ingress, the sealing of pathways, and water removal actions. Should mitigating strategies <br />fail, the unanalyzed pathways could permit an indeterminate amount of leakage into the Auxiliary building, potentially <br />challenging the ability of safety-related equipment to perform the specified safety function during an accident. There <br />were no actual consequences. <br />G. Basis for Reportability <br />This event is reported pursuant to the following criteria: <br />10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii): <br />Any event of condition that resulted in <br />(B) The nuclear power plant being in an unanalyzed condition that significantly degraded plant safety <br />10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v) <br />Any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems <br />that are needed to: <br />(B) Remove residual heat (ANO-1 and ANO-2 Decay Heat Removal system) <br />H. Additional Information <br />10 CFR 50.73(b)(5) states that this report shall contain reference to "any previous similar events at the same plant that <br />are known to the licensee." NU REG-1022 reporting guidance states that term "previous occurrences" should include <br />previous events or conditions that involved the same underlying concern or reason as this event, such as the same <br />root cause, failure, or sequence of events. <br />A review of the ANO corrective action program and Licensee Event Reports for the previous three years was <br />performed. This review identified conditions that were previously identified deficiencies in the flood barrier program. <br />Two relevant similar events were identified. These events are discussed below. <br />On April 7, 2015, during preparation of walk down packages for flood barrier inspections, two credible flood paths <br />were identified between an unscheduled junction box located in the ANO-2 Turbine Building (floor elevation 329 ft., <br />approximately 4 feet off the floor) and lighting receptacles in the Auxiliary Building elevation 317 ft. The apparent <br />cause of this condition was the failure to recognize a drawing note which identified the junction box seal in addition <br />to the lighting panel seals. <br />In addition to the above, one Licensee Event Report (50-313/2014-001-00) was submitted to the NRC (described in <br />Section C above) on May 5, 2014 (ML14125A483). <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />(See Page 2 for required number of <br />digits/characters for each block) <br />NRC FORM 366 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />Page 4 of 5 <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />Page 5 of 5 <br />NRC FORM 366 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />e''"''', <br />-, 	 LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />(See Page 2 for required number of <br />digits/characters for each block) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours. <br />Reported lessons learned are incorporated into the licensing process and fed back to <br />industry.
