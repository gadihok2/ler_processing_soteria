ABSTRACT (Limit to 1400 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced type written lines) <br />On March 7, 2016, while performing set-up activities for 2-PT-R084C, 	 "23 EDG 8 Hour Load <br />Test," the normal supply breaker to 480 Volt AC Bus (ED) 3A tripped on overcurrent. This <br />caused 480 Volt AC Buses 3A and 6A to de-energize since, as part of the test set-up <br />activities, the tie breaker (3AT6A) between Buses 3A and 6A was closed and the normal <br />supply breaker for Bus 6A was opened. This resulted in a loss of both 21 and 22 Residual <br />Heat Removal 	 (RHR) 	 {BP} pumps. As 'designed, all Emergency Diesel Generators <br />	 (EDGs) 	 {EK} <br />received automatic initiation signals to start. All required 480 Volt AC buses <br />automatically re-energized by design, with the exception of Bus 3A, which had an <br />overcurrent lockout. Operators manually started 22 RHR pump to restore RHR cooling. <br />However, prior to restoring the normal supply power to Bus 3A, 23 EDG tripped on <br />overcurrent which resulted in a second loss of RIM event. The cause for the Bus 3A <br />supply breaker tripping was inadequate procedural guidance resulting in excessive loads <br />being energized on Buses 3A and 6A. The direct cause for 23 EDG tripping was cracked <br />solder joints on the automatic voltage regulator (AVR). Corrective actions included <br />revising 2-PT-R084C and replacing the voltage regulator. The event had no effect on <br />public health and safety. <br />NRC FORM 366AU.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(01-2014) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />FACILITY NAME (1) DOCKET (2) LER NUMBER (6) PAGE (3) <br />YEAR <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER  <br />REVISION <br />NUMBER <br />Indian Point Unit 2  05000-247  2016 	 002 	 01  2 OF 6 <br />NARRATIVE (If more space is required, use additional copies of NRC Form 366A) (17) <br />Note: 	 The Energy Industry Identification System Codes are identified within the <br />brackets {}. <br />DESCRIPTION OF EVENT <br />On March 7, 2016 at approximately 10:18 hours, with Indian Point Unit 2 in Cold <br />Shutdown, Mode 5, Operations test personnel were performing set-up activities for <br />surveillance procedure 2-PT-R084C, "23 EDG 8 Hour Load Test," when the normal supply <br />breaker to 480 Volt AC Bus {ED} 3A tripped on overcurrent. This caused both 480 Volt <br />AC Buses 3A and 6A to de-energize since, as part of the load test set-up activities, <br />the tie breaker (3AT6A) between Buses 3A and 6A was required to be closed and the <br />normal supply breaker for Bus 6A was required to be opened. The 8-hour load test was <br />designed such that 23 EDG would power the loads on 480 Volt AC Buses 3A and 6A <br />simultaneously. Approximately 14 minutes after cross-tying Bus 3A to Bus 6A and <br />opening the Bus 6A normal supply breaker, the normal supply breaker to Bus 3A tripped <br />on overcurrent. This resulted in a loss of assigned loads for both Bus 3A and 6A <br />including 21 and 22 Residual Heat Removal (RHR) {BP} pumps, and 21 Spent Fuel Pool <br />(SFP) {DA} pump. Technical Specification LCO 3.4.7 requires one RHR loop to be <br />operable and in operation, and either the non-operating RHR to be operable and capable <br />of being powered, or the secondary side water level in at least two steam generators to <br />be greater than or equal to 0-percent narrow range. Technical Specification 3.4.7 <br />Condition C was entered and operations personnel immediately initiated actions to <br />restore one RHR loop to operation. There were no SSCs that were inoperable at the <br />beginning of the event which contributed to the event. As designed, 21, 22, and 23 <br />Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs) {EK} received automatic engineered safety feature <br />(ESF) start signals because of the loss of voltage on 480 Volt AC Bus 6A. As part of <br />the load test set-up activities 23 EDG had already been running, although not tied to <br />Bus 6A yet. At the time that both RHR pumps were de-energized, 24 Reactor Coolant Pump <br />(RCP) {AB} was in operation and providing forced circulation in the reactor coolant <br />system. The Main Steam System {SB} was available and the steam generators were coupled <br />(i.e. pressurizer level and steam generator levels were adequate) thus decay heat <br />removal was never lost. All 480 Volt AC buses re-energized automatically by design, <br />with the exception of Bus 3A. Bus 3A had an overcurrent lockout that prevented 22 EDG <br />from automatically loading onto the bus. At approximately 10:19, 22 RHR pump was <br />started to restore RHR cooling. This event was recorded in the Indian Point Energy <br />Center corrective action program as CR-1P2-2016-01256. <br />On March 7, 2016 at approximately 11:32 hours, before operators were able to complete <br />the restoration of the normal supply power to Bus 3A, 23 EDG un-expectantly tripped on <br />overcurrent. This resulted in a second automatic EDG engineered safety feature start <br />signal which de-energiZed 480 Volt AC Buses 5A, 2A, 3A and 6A, and generated a start <br />signal to the EDGs. This event was recorded in the Indian Point Energy Center <br />corrective action'program as CR-1P2-2016-01260. Both loops of RHR cooling were lost <br />because of 480 Volt AC Buses 3A and 6A being de-energized. At approximately 11:35 <br />hours, Operations personnel manually started 21 RHR to restore residual heat removal <br />capability as required by Technical Specification 3.4.7 Condition C. <br />NRC FORM 366AU.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(01-2014) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />FACILITY NAME (1) DOCKET (2) LER NUMBER (6) PAGE (3) <br />YEAR <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER  <br />REVISION <br />NUMBER <br />Indian Point Unit 2  05000-247  2016 	 002 	 01  3 OF 6 <br />NARRATIVE (If more space is required, use additional copies of NRC Form 366A) (17) <br />On March 9, 2016 at approximately 20:41 hours, Operations test personnel had <br />Commenced surveillance test 2-PT-R014, "Automatic Safety Injection System Electrical <br />Load and Blackout Test". During the test, the voltage on 480 Volt AC Bus 6A dropped <br />to approximately 200 volts when 23 Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) Pump was sequenced to <br />the bus. This event was recorded in Indian Point Energy Center corrective action <br />program as CR-IP2-2016-01430. <br />On March 11, 2016 further investigation of the condition concluded that the <br />automatic voltage regulation (AVR) system for 23 EDG was not functioning properly. <br />The AVR was replaced and 23 EDG was tested successfully and declared operable. The <br />specific failure mechanism in the AVR was under investigation by a vendor. This <br />condition was recorded in Indian Point Energy Center corrective action program as <br />CR-IP2-2016-01260. <br />The onsite AC power distribution system includes 480 Volt AC Buses 5A, 6A, 2A and 3A <br />which are divided into three safeguards power trains. The three safeguards power <br />trains are Train 5A (Bus 5A and 21 EDG), Train 6A (Bus 6A and 23 EDG), and Train 2A/3A <br />(Bus 2A and 3A and 22 EDG). The 480 Volt AC buses receive power from 6.9 kV bus <br />sections through their respective Station Service Transformer {FK} (SST) or from <br />associated onsite EDGs. The 480 Volt AC buses are designed with protection against <br />undervoltage (UV) and degraded grid voltage (DGV) using relays that sense UV or DGV <br />conditions. <br />In Mode 5 with the reactor coolant system (RCS) loops filled, the reactor coolant is <br />circulated by means of two RHR loops connected to the RCS, each loop containing an <br />RHR heat exchanger, an RHR pump, and appropriate flow and temperature <br />instrumentation for control, protection, and indication. One RHR pump circulates <br />the water through the RCS at a sufficient rate to prevent boric acid stratification. <br />The number of loops in operation can vary to suit the operational needs. The intent <br />of LCO 3.4.7 is to provide forced flow from at least one RHR loop for decay heat <br />removal and transport. The flow provided by one RHR loop is adequate for decay heat <br />removal. The other intent of LCO 3.4.7 is to require that a second path be <br />available to provide redundancy for heat removal. <br />NRC FORM 366AU.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(01-2014) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />FACILITY NAME (1) DOCKET (2) LER NUMBER (6) PAGE (3) <br />YEAR <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER  <br />REVISION <br />NUMBER <br />Indian Point Unit 2  05000-247  2016 	 002 	 01  4 OF 6 <br />NARRATIVE (If more space is required, use additional copies of NRC Form 366A) (17) <br />Cause of Event <br />The direct cause of the event that occurred on March 7, 2016 at approximately 10:18 <br />hours was a loss of power to 480 Volt Bus 3A when the normal supply breaker from <br />Station Service Transformer (SST-3) tripped on overcurrent due to excessive loads <br />energized on Bus 3A and Bus 6A. As designed, this caused the 480 Volt AC buses to <br />strip loads, resulting in the loss of both 21 and 22 RHR Pumps, 21 SFP Pump, lighting <br />and various other loads. <br />The apparent cause was inadequate guidance in 2-PT-R084C resulting in excessive loads <br />energized on Buses 3A and 6A. Procedure 2-PT-R084C contained a precaution and <br />limitation to limit current on the 3AT6A cross tie breaker but contained no guidelines <br />on limiting current on the Bus 3A normal supply breaker (i.e. breaker overcurrent trip <br />point was listed but this was for information only and there are no meters where this <br />current can be read). At the time, SST-3 was carrying approximately 260 amps. <br />Procedure 2-PT-R084C was subsequently revised to include a precaution and limitation to <br />maintain SST loads less than 200 amps. <br />The direct cause for the second transient that occurred on March 7, 2016 at <br />approximately 11:32 hours was determined to be cracked solder connections on the 23 EDG <br />AVR circuit card. Following a microscopic inspection of the solder joints for the <br />magnetic amplifier by the vendor, it was determined that all nine terminals for the Ll <br />magnetic amplifier exhibited solder cracking. Based upon the cyclic heating and <br />cooling of the Ll magnetic amplifier, it was concluded that thermal growth of the Ll <br />magnetic amplifier relative to the card could have caused cyclic stress on the solder <br />joints. TherefOre, thermally-induced stress is the most likely cause of the solder <br />joint cracks. The apparent cause was the failure to establish a PM strategy in <br />accordance with a Part 21 notification and vendor's maintenance bulletin for the AVR <br />card defect. Based on the intermittent nature of this failure in addition to <br />elimination of all remaining potential causes, it is with high confidence that the <br />cause for the overcurrent trip event which occurred on March 7, 2016 was the result of <br />the intermittent symptoms associated with the degraded connections on the AVR assembly. <br />This condition was recorded in the Indian Point Energy Center corrective action program <br />(CAP) as CR-1P2-2016-02944. <br />NRC FORM 366AU.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(01-2014) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />FACILITY NAME (1) DOCKET (2) LER NUMBER (6) PAGE (3) <br />YEAR <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER  <br />REVISION <br />NUMBER <br />Indian Point Unit 2  05000-247  2016 - 002 	 01  5 OF 6 <br />NARRATIVE (If more space is required, use additional copies of NRC Form 366A) (17) <br />Corrective Actions <br />The following corrective actions have been or will be performed under the Corrective <br />Action Program (CAP) to address the causes of this event. <br />• Revised 2-PT-R084A, B and C to include maintaining SST loads less than 200 amps. <br />This revision also added critical steps, one of which is verifying that SST load <br />will be less than 200 amps after bus cross-tie is performed. <br />• The entire scope of Operations test activities was reviewed. Activities that had an <br />impact on a shutdown key safety function were identified and reviewed to ensure that <br />procedure quality was adequate. <br />• Past operability of 23 EDG was assessed. The AVR assembly was removed from 23 <br />EDG and was tested successfully in accordance with the manufacturer's factory <br />acceptance testing procedures <br />the results from the vendor's <br />surveillance tests, there was <br />tripping on March 7, 2016. <br />Event Analysis <br />in spite of the cracked solder joints. Based upon <br />failure analysis and previous satisfactory <br />no indication that 23 EDG was inoperable before <br />The event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A). The licensee shall report any <br />event or condition that resulted in the manual or automatic actuation of any system <br />listed in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B). The systems to which the requirements of 10 CFR <br />50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) apply include (#8) Emergency AC electrical power systems including <br />emergency diesel generators. The actuation and start of the EDGs on the two occasions <br />on March 7, 2016 at 10:18 hours and 11:32 hours meet the reporting criteria. <br />Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(B), the loss of both 21 and 22 RHR loops was not <br />considered to be a loss of safety function needed for residual heat removal, since at <br />least one RHR pump was always capable of being powered by either the onsite or offsite <br />power sources. <br />In accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A), on March 7, 2016, at 17:12 hours, an eight <br />hour non-emergency notification (#51775) was made for an event or condition which <br />resulted in a valid actuation of the EDGs. The event was recorded in the Indian Point <br />Energy Center corrective action program (CAP) as CR-IP2-2016-01256. <br />NRC FORM 366AU.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(01-2014) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />FACILITY NAME (1) DOCKET (2) LER NUMBER (6) PAGE (3) <br />YEAR <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER  <br />REVISION <br />NUMBER <br />Indian Point Unit 2  05000-247 2016 	 002 	 01 6 OF 6 <br />NARRATIVE (If more space is required, use additional copies of NRC Form 366A) (17) <br />Past Similar Events <br />A review of the past five years of Licensee Event Reports (LERs) for events reporting <br />valid Emergency Diesel Gerierator automatic actuations occurring during surveillance <br />testing did not find any similar events. <br />Safety Significance <br />This event had no safety consequences on the health and safety of the public. In <br />general, when the unit is shut down, the Technical Specifications requirements ensure <br />that the unit has the capability to mitigate the consequences of postulated accidents. <br />However, assuming a single failure and concurrent loss of all offsite or all onsite <br />power is not. required. The rationale for Xhis is based on the fact that many Design <br />Basis Accidents (DBAs) that are analyzed in MODES 1, 2, 3, and 4 have no specific <br />analyses in MODES 5 and 6. Worst case bounding events are deemed not credible in MODES <br />5 and 6 because the energy contained within the reactor pressure boundary, reactor <br />coolant temperature and pressure, and the corresponding stresses result in the <br />probabilities of occurrence being significantly reduced or eliminated, and have minimal <br />consequences. <br />There were no actual implications from the event since there were no DBAs or <br />radiological releases. During this event there were always two EDGs capable of <br />supplying two safeguards power trains of the onsite AC electrical power distribution <br />subsystems. Power from the offsite sources was available, and the ESF actuation <br />circuitry and EDGs performed in accordance with design. The minimum safeguards <br />power was available to power safety loads. At the time that both RHR pumps were de-<br />energized, 24 Reactor Coolant Pump (RCP) was in operation and providing forced <br />circulation in the reactor coolant system. The Main Steam System {S13} was available <br />and the steam generators were coupled (i.e. pressurizer level and steam generator <br />levels were adequate) thus decay heat removal was never lost.<br /></span>
