Reactor Operators lowered RTP to 91.0 percent and at 1518 EST, the TBVs automatically <br />closed and the TSV closure and TCV fast closure RPS functions were no longer considered inoperable. <br />TS 3.3.1.1 requires that the TSV closure and TCV fast closure RPS functions be operable at or above 29.5 percent RTP. <br />An event notification and follow up notification (No. 51755) were made to the NRC based on meeting the reporting criteria <br />of 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v)(A) and (D). <br />This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v), as an event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of <br />the safety function of systems that are needed to: (A) shut down the reactor and maintain it in a safe shutdown condition <br />and (D) mitigate the consequences of an accident. <br />In addition, since this event affected all channels of the TSV closure and TCV fast closure RPS functions, this event is <br />reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii), as an event where a single cause or condition caused two independent <br />channels to become inoperable in a single system designed to: (A) shut down the reactor and maintain it in a safe <br />shutdown condition and (D) mitigate the consequences of an accident. <br />There were no radiological releases associated with this event. <br />Significant Safety Consequences and Implications <br />There were no significant safety consequences associated with this event.

LER NUMBER  <br />Fermi 2 341 <br />YEAR SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />REV <br />NO. <br />2016 001 01 <br />NARRATIVE <br />Per Chapter 15 of the Fermi 2 Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR), the TCV fast closure function is the <br />primary scram signal for the generator load rejection event. For this event, the reactor scram reduces the amount of <br />energy required to be absorbed and ensures that the Minimum Critical Power Ratio (MCPR) Safety Limit (SL) is not <br />exceeded. TCV fast closure signals are initiated by the de-energization of the solenoid dump valve at each control valve. <br />This function must be enabled at RTP greater than or equal to 29.5 percent. <br />Per Chapter 15 of the Fermi 2 UFSAR, the TSV closure function is the primary scram signal for the turbine trip event. For <br />this event, the reactor scram reduces the amount of energy required to be absorbed and ensures that the MCPR SL is not <br />exceeded. TSV closure signals are initiated from position switches located on each of the four TSVs. This function must <br />be enabled at RTP greater than or equal to 29.5 percent. <br />Four Turbine First Stage Pressure (TFSP) transmitters [[PT]] are provided to initiate the automatic bypass of the TCV fast <br />closure and TSV closure scrams, when the first stage pressure is below a preset fraction of rated pressure corresponding <br />to approximately 29.5 percent of rated power. <br />The TBVs, if open at power levels above 29.5 percent RTP, may cause the TSV closure and TCV fast closure RPS <br />functions to be inadvertently bypassed due to the diversion of steam flow away from the TFSP transmitters. In this event, <br />during the period of time while TBVs were open, reactor power was maintained above 91 percent and the RPS functions <br />were confirmed to be enabled. Therefore, there was no actual impact on safety. <br />Cause of the Event <br />The valve actuator malfunction and TSV position drift was caused by a failed Valve Control Module (VCM) servo driver to <br />Unitized Actuator (UA) servo valve loop initiating a valve close position signal. The apparent cause was faulty connectors <br />in the UA due to wear and fatigue. The contributing cause was circuit resistance measurement of the VCM to UA servo <br />loop was not being performed. <br />Corrective Actions <br />The faulty connectors were replaced. <br />Additional corrective actions included: testing continuity of the servo valve circuit to identify and repair degraded <br />conditions, developing a Preventative Maintenance (PM) task to address Extent of Condition on other modulating valves <br />during refueling outages, and adjusting the maintenance frequency on the actuators to limit service time to 6 refueling <br />outages. <br />This event was documented and evaluated in the Fermi 2 Corrective Action Program. All corrective actions have been <br />completed. <br />Additional Information <br />A.
