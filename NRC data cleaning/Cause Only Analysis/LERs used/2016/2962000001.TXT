Following the scram, the reactor mode switch was placed in the shutdown position. <br />On April 16, 2000, at 0835 hours CDT, plant operators commenced performance of surveillance Reactor <br />Protection System Mode Switch in Shutdown Scram and Logic System Functional Test. This test requires <br />that the mode switch be moved out of the shutdown position. On April 17, 2000, at approximately 1735 <br />hours CDT, following satisfactory completion of mode switch testing, it was determined that 3-SR-3.3.1.2.4, <br />Source Range Monitor (SRM) System Count Rate and Signal to Noise Ratio Check, was not performed as <br />required. The SR was subsequently completed at approximately 2235 hours CDT. SRMs A, B, and D were <br />found to be operable. Following completion of the SRM system test, it was determined that the mode switch <br />testing had been conducted in violation of an action statement for inoperable SRMs which required the mode <br />switch to be in the shutdown position. Therefore, TVA is reporting this event in accordance with 10 CFR <br />50.73 (a)(2)(i)(B), as any operation or condition prohibited by the plants Technical Specifications. The root <br />cause of this event was inadequate procedures, which resulted in misapplication of the requirements for <br />operability of the SRMs. Corrective actions included revisions to appropriate procedures and personnel <br />training. <br />NRC FORM 366B (6-1998) <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(6-1998) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />TEXT CONTINUATION <br />FACILITY NAME (1) DOCKET LER NUMBER (6) PAGE (3) <br />YEAR SEQUENTIAL <br />	 REVISION <br />NUMBER 2 of 8 <br />Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant - Unit 3 <br />05000296 2000 -- 002 __ 00 <br />TEXT (If more space is required, use additional copies of NRC Form 366A) (17) <br />I. PLANT CONDITION(S) <br />At the time of the event, Unit 3 was in Mode 3 (Hot Shutdown) in a scheduled refueling outage. <br />Previously, on April 15, 2000, at 1226 hours Central Daylight Time (CDT), Unit 3 received an <br />automatic reactor scram from 70 percent power. For details surrounding the reactor scram see BFN <br />LER 296/2000-001. Unit 2 was at 100 percent power, approximately 3458 Megawatts thermal, and <br />Unit 1 was shutdown and defueled. <br />II. DESCRIPTION OF EVENT <br />A. Event• <br />On April 15, 2000, with the Unit 3 Reactor in Mode 3 (hot shutdown), in accordance with <br />Abnormal Operating Instruction (A01) 3-A0I-100-1, Reactor Scram, Operations checked to <br />ensure surveillances 3-SR-3.3.1.2.5&6, Source Range Monitor Functional Test With Reactor <br />Mode Switch Not in Run Position, and 3-SR-3.3.1.2.7 (A, B, C, and D), Source Range Monitor <br />(SRM) [IG] Calibration and Functional test, were in their periodicity. From the check, it was <br />determined that 3-SR-3.3.1.2.5&6 was out of the periodicity, and on April 15, 2000, at 1426 hours <br />CDT, Operations commenced performance of the surveillance. The surveillance was <br />successfully completed by 1761 hours CDT, and SRMs A, B, and D were declared operable. <br />Source Range Monitor C was inoperable prior to the scram. TSs require only two channels to be <br />operable when in Mode 3. Thus, the operators considered the minimum required channels to be <br />operable with C channel inoperable. <br />On April 16, 2000, at 0820 hours CDT, the Unit 3 Operators commenced Surveillance 3-SR-<br />3.10.2, Verification of Surveillance Requirements For Reactor Mode Switch Interlock Testing. <br />This was in anticipation of performing Surveillance 3-SR-3.3.1.1.12, Reactor Protection System <br />Mode Switch in Shutdown Scram and Logic System Functional Test. Surveillance 3-SR-3.10.2 <br />requires that the operators verify that all control rods located in core cells containing one or more <br />fuel assemblies are fully inserted and, there are no core alterations in progress. The <br />requirements of 3-SR-3.10.2 were subsequently verified to be complete. <br />On April 16, 2000, at approximately 0835 hours CDT, the plant operators commenced <br />performance of Surveillance 3-SR-3.3.1.1.12. This test required moving the reactor mode switch <br />[XIS][JE] out of shutdown. The test on the reactor mode switch was completed satisfactorily at <br />approximately 1225 hours CDT. <br />On April 17, 2000, at approximately 1735 hours CDT, operators determined that 3-SR-3.3.1.2.4, <br />Source Range Monitor System Count Rate and Signal to Noise Ratio Check, had not been <br />performed as required. The SR was commenced and successfully completed at approximately <br />2235 hours for SRMs A, B, and D. Following the successful completion of 3-SR-3.3.1.2.4 on <br />April 17, 2000, the NRC Resident Inspector questioned TVA's implementation of the TS <br />requirements for TS LCO 3.3.1.2, Condition D, and TS LCO 3.10.2. <br />This condition was not considered reportable as a missed surveillance since the actions for <br />inoperable SRMs (Mode switch in Shutdown and all insertable control rods inserted) had been <br />met since the reactor scram. TVA's response to the resident inspector was that TS LCO 3.10.2 <br />NRC FORM 366 (6-1998) <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(6-1998) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />TEXT CONTINUATION <br />FACILITY NAME (1) DOCKET LER NUMBER (6) PAGE (3) <br />YEAR SEQUENTIAL <br />	 REVISION <br />NUMBER 3 of 8 <br />Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant - Unit 3 <br />05000296 2000 -- 002 __ 00 <br />TEXT (If more space is required, use additional copies of NRC Form 366A) (17) <br />authorizes mode switch movement, and that all of the requirements of TS 3.10.2 were <br />implemented. This was based on the following: <br />The SRMs have no safety function and are not assumed to function during a Final Safety <br />Analysis Report design basis accident or transient analysis. The SRMs are utilized during <br />refueling, shutdown, and low power operations to provide the primary indication of neutron <br />flux levels. The SRMs provide monitoring of reactivity changes during fuel or control rod <br />movement and give the control room operator early indication of subcritical multiplication <br />that could be indicative of an approach to criticality. <br />Technical Specification (TS) Section 3.3.1.2 Source Range Monitor Instrumentation, TS LCO <br />3.3.1.2, Condition D, requires with one or more SRMs inoperable in Mode 3, fully insert all <br />insertable control rods and, place the reactor mode switch in the shutdown position. <br />The TS Basis for TS LCO 3.3.1.2, Condition D, concludes that with one or more required <br />SRMs inoperable in Mode 3 the neutron flux monitoring capability is degraded or <br />nonexistent. Further, the requirement to fully insert all insertable control rods ensures that <br />the reactor will be at its minimum reactivity level while no neutron monitoring capability is <br />available. Placing the reactor mode switch in the shutdown position prevents subsequent <br />control rod withdrawal by maintaining a control rod block. <br />TS Section 3.10, Special Operations, Reactor Mode Switch Testing, LCO 3.10.2 provides <br />specific allowances for changing the mode switch position for interlock testing. The LCO <br />states in part, that the reactor mode switch position for Mode 3 may be changed to include <br />the run position, startup/hot standby position, and refuel position, and operation considered <br />not to be in power operation or startup, to allow testing of the instrumentation associated with <br />the reactor mode switch interlock functions, provided a) all control rods remain fully inserted <br />in core cells containing one or more fuel assemblies, and b) no core alterations are in <br />progress. <br />The TS Basis for TS LCO 3.10.2 indicates the interlock functions of the shutdown and refuel <br />reactor mode switch positions normally maintained for the reactor mode switch in Mode 3 <br />are provided to preclude reactivity excursions that could potentially result in fuel failure. <br />Interlock testing that requires moving the reactor mode switch to either positions (run, <br />startup/hot standby, or refuel) while in Mode 3 requires administratively maintaining all <br />control rods inserted and no other core alterations in progress. <br />The requirements for utilizing TS LCO 3.10.2 are stipulated in TS Section 3.0 Limiting <br />Condition for Operation Applicability , TS LCO 3.0.7. This LCO states: Special Operations <br />LCOs in Section 3.10 allow specified TS requirements to be changed to permit performance <br />of special test and operations. Unless otherwise specified, all other TS requirements remain <br />unchanged. The Basis of TS 3.0.7 clearly addresses the other TS requirements by defining <br />all other TS requirements as those "not directly associated with or required to be changed to <br />perform the special test or operation will remain in effect". <br />TS LCO 3.10.2 specifies that no other requirements than the definition of reactor modes <br />applies. By changing the definition of Reactor Modes, the TSs authorize moving the mode <br />switch out of the shutdown position when the additional requirements specified by TS LCO <br />3.10.2 are implemented. Because the TS definitions apply throughout the TSs, it can be  <br />NRC FORM 366 (6-1998) <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(6-1998) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />TEXT CONTINUATION <br />FACILITY NAME (1) DOCKET LER NUMBER (6) PAGE (3) <br />YEAR SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />REVISION <br />4 of 8 <br />Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant - Unit 3 <br />05000296 2000 -- 002 __ 00 <br />TEXT (If more space is required, use additional copies of NRC Form 366A) (17) <br />concluded that TS requirements are also changed. Since the required mode switch position <br />is changed by TS LCO 3.10.2, the required action statement in TS LCO 3.3.2.1 for <br />inoperable SRMs which requires the mode switch to be placed in the shutdown position was <br />"directly associated with or required to be changed to perform the special test." <br />As can be realized from above the discussion, the TS Bases for TS 3.10.2 take no credit for <br />the SRMs during reactor mode switch testing. However, the specifications rely on activities <br />that preclude an unexpected reactivity excursion. That is, all control rods are fully inserted <br />and no core alterations are taking place. Thus, it can be concluded that the actions specified <br />by TS 3.10.2 compensate for the conditions requiring the mode switch to be in the shutdown <br />position. Moving the mode switch from shutdown bypasses the control rod block, which was <br />the Basis for the TS LCO 3.3.1.2 action. The basis for TS LCO 3.10.2 clearly state that with <br />the controls in place (i.e., all control rods fully inserted and no core alterations), there is "no <br />credible mechanism for unacceptable reactivity excursions during the planned interlock <br />testing." <br />Based on the above discussion, there is no clear guidance in the TSs that state the steps <br />taken to test the mode switch was a condition prohibited by the TSs. TS 3.10.2. do not take <br />credit for SRM monitoring during mode switch testing. The requirements of TS LCO fully <br />compensate for the lack of a control rod block the which is the bases for LCO 3.3.1.2, <br />Condition D. <br />Following this discussion with the TVA staff, the NRC Senior Resident Inspector contacted the <br />NRC Office Of Nuclear Reactor Regulation (NRR) for an interpretation. NRR concluded that TS <br />LCO 3.10.2 does not apply to the requirement for mode switch position with inoperable SRMs. <br />Therefore, because of the failure to properly comply with the TS requirements for the source <br />range monitor operability, during mode switch testing, this event is reportable in accordance with <br />10 CFR 50.73 (a)(2)(i)(B) as any operation or condition prohibited by the plants Technical <br />Specifications. <br />B.

Immediate Cause <br />         <br /> <br />Operations performed surveillance 3-SR-3.3.1.1.12 which moved the mode switch out of the <br />Shutdown position under the allowances of TS LCO 3.10.2 without the completion of all the <br />required surveillances for SRMs. <br />    <br /> <br />B. Root Cause <br />         <br /> <br />The root cause of this event was inadequate procedures which resulted in misapplication of the <br />requirements for operability of the SRMs. <br />Abnormal Operating Instruction, 3-A0I-100-1, Reactor Scram, included steps to verify two of the <br />four required SRs were in periodicity however, did not direct the operator to initiate 3-SR-<br />3.3.1.2.4 to perform Source Range Monitor System Count Signal to Noise Ratio Check. Also, <br />surveillance 3-SR-2 contained confusing detail. It implied that the signal to noise ratio <br />surveillance was only required during fuel movement <br />Additionally, General Operating Instruction, 3-G01-100-12A, Unit Shutdown From Power <br />Operation To Cold Shutdown and Reductions In Power During Power Operations did not specify <br />performance of the SRM signal to noise ratio test. <br />  <br />   <br /> <br />C.

ANALYSIS OF THE EVENT <br />          <br />  <br />3-A0I-100-1 did not include the requirement for performing 3-SR-3.3.1.2.4. Surveillance 3-SR-2 <br />specified that 3-SR-3.3.1.2.4 was applicable when the reactor was in hot shutdown but contained <br />confusing notes that implied that 3-SR- 3.3.1.2.4 was only required during core alterations. This <br />oversight was discovered on April 17, 2000, at approximately 1735 hours. On April 17, at 2235 hours, <br />following completion of 3-SR-3.3.1.2.4, SRMs A, B, and D were declared operable. SRM C was <br />inoperable prior to the scram. TS require only two channels to be operable when in Mode 3. Thus, the <br />operators considered the minimum required channels to be operable with C channel inoperable. <br />  <br />    <br />  <br />V. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES <br />          <br />  <br />The SRMs have no safety function and are not assumed to function during a Final Safety Analysis <br />Report design basis accident or transient analysis. The SRMs provide monitoring of neutron flux levels <br />during startup and refueling operations. They provide monitoring of reactivity changes during fuel or <br />control rod movement and give the control room operator early indication of subcritical multiplication that <br />could be indicative of an approach to criticality. During the event, Unit 3 was in Mode 3 with all control <br />rods inserted, and the vessel head closure bolts fully tensioned. <br />BFN TS 3.3.1.2 requires, with one or more required SRMs inoperable in Mode 3, within one hour, fully <br />insert all insertable control rods and place the reactor mode switch in the shutdown position. BFN TSs <br />provide specific allowances for changing the mode switch position for conducting interlock testing under <br />specific circumstances. TS LCO 3.10.2 states that the reactor mode switch position for Modes 3 may be <br />changed to include the run position, startup/hot standby position, and refuel position, and operation <br />considered not to be in power operation or startup, to allow testing of the instrumentation associated with <br />the reactor mode switch interlock functions, provided, a) all control rods remain fully inserted in core cells <br />containing one or more fuel assemblies, and b) no core alterations are in progress. These conditions <br />were maintained at all times during the mode switch testing. <br />  <br />  <br />The TS Basis for TS LCO 3.10.2 states, "with all control rods inserted in core cells containing one or <br />more fuel assemblies, and no core alterations in progress, there are no credible mechanisms for <br />unacceptable reactivity excursions during planned interlock testing." <br />    <br />  <br />During the Mode Switch testing, all control rods remained inserted and no core alterations were <br />conducted. Additionally, subsequent successful performance of the signal to noise ratio surveillance <br />proved that the SRMs were operable during mode switch testing. Accordingly, there were no actual or <br />potential safety consequences as a result of this event. <br />  <br />             <br />NRC FORM 366 (6-1998) <br />          <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(6-1998) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />TEXT CONTINUATION <br />PAGE (3) FACILITY NAME (1) 	 II 	 DOCKET LER NUMBER (61 <br />YEAR SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />REVISION <br />7 of 8 <br />Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant - Unit 3 <br />05000296 2000 -- 002 __ 00 <br />TEXT (If more space is required, use additional copies of NRC Form 366A) (17) <br />VI. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS <br />A. Immediate Corrective Actions  <br />The required SRs were performed and SRMs A, B, and D were verified to be operable. <br />Abnormal Operating Instruction (A01), Reactor Scram, 3-A0I-100-1, was revised, directing the <br />operator to initiate SRM count rate and signal to noise ratio check. Surveillance instruction, <br />Instrument Checks and Observations, 3-SR-2, was revised clarifying when SRM signal to noise <br />ratio testing is required <br />Additionally, General Operating Instruction (G01), 3-G01-100-12A, Unit Shutdown From Power <br />Operation To Cold Shutdown and Reductions In Power During Power Operations, was revised <br />providing guidance on operability of the SRMs and adding the requirement to perform source <br />range monitor system count rate and signal to noise ratio check after unit shutdown. <br />B. Corrective Actions to Prevent Recurrence <br />TVA will perform additional procedure reviews to ensure requirements for other Special <br />Operations TSs have been adequately implemented'. <br />Training will be provided to licensed Operators on TS 3.10.2 requirements and other special <br />operations TSsl. <br />VII. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION <br />A. Failed Components  <br />None. <br />B. Previous LERs on Similar Events <br />LER 260/1999-002, issued On May 6, 1999, discusses inadequate implementation of TS <br />surveillance requirements during the performance of 2-SR-3.10.4, Verification of Surveillance <br />Requirements for Single Control Rod Withdrawal - Cold Shutdown. During Control Rod Drive <br />system testing, the SR for verification that all control rods other than the control rod being <br />withdrawn, are fully inserted was not performed at the required frequency. The plant surveillance <br />was written to apply to the withdrawal of single control rods during the testing evolution, the <br />instruction was improperly used to document multiple withdrawals of single control rods during <br />testing evolution.
