EXPECTED <br />SUBMISSION <br />DATE <br />MONTH DAY YEAR <br />ABSTRACT (Limit to 1400 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) <br />On June 24, 2016, a channel calibration was performed to return the Delta-T/Tavg Channel IV instrument to operable <br />status following digital filter processor card replacement. Instrumentation & Control (I&C) maintenance personnel <br />performed the channel calibration using a digital multi-meter (DMM) that defaulted to a lower impedance setting than <br />the DMM normally used for the calibration. This impacted the set points. As a result, Delta-T/Tavg Channel IV was <br />adjusted incorrectly and returned to service (the Overtemperature delta-T (OTDT) trip function was taken out of the <br />tripped condition) on June 25, 2016, at 0215 Eastern Daylight Time. On June 27, 2016, Reactor Engineering noticed <br />that Tavg had taken a step change lower following the card replacement. On June 29, 2016, operators authorized <br />performance of a functional test for Delta-T/Tavg Channel IV and Unit 1 entered Technical Specification (TS) 3.3.1 <br />Conditions A and E. During the functional test, Delta-T/Tavg was found to be out of TS tolerance. Following <br />adjustment, on June 29 at 2205 operators declared Delta-T/Tavg Channel IV operable. On July 14, a past operability <br />evaluation determined Channel IV of the OTDT trip function was in a noncompliance state longer than allowed by TS. <br />The cause of the event was l&C maintenance personnel were not trained with the operation of the Fluke 8845A DMM. <br />Corrective actions include adding labeling to all Fluke 8845A DMMs to call attention to the impedance function of the <br />device, briefing technicians on operation of the Fluke 8445A DMM, and revising the procedure associated with <br />measuring & test equipment (M&TE) to require a training performance analysis worksheet for all new M&TE. <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />1.

PLANT OPERATING CONDITIONS BEFORE THE EVENT <br />At the time of the event, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Unit 1 was in Mode 1 at 100 percent rated <br />thermal power. The condition described in this LER did not impact SQN Unit 2. <br />II. DESCRIPTION OF EVENTS <br />A. Event: <br />On June 23, 2016, at 2015 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), main control room (MCR) operators <br />received an unexpected annunciator [El IS: ANN] for "Protection Set Channel [El IS: CHA] Set <br />Failure." On June 24 at 0100, Instrumentation & Control (I&C) investigation revealed the digital <br />filter processor card was the cause of the alarm. This affected the Delta-T/Tavg for Channel IV. <br />One of the reactor trips associated with the Delta-T/Tavg channel is the Overtemperature delta-T <br />(OTDT) trip function. Unit 1 entered Technical Specification (TS) 3.3.1 Conditions A and E for an <br />inoperable channel of the OTDT trip function. <br />Two digital filter processor cards associated with Delta-T/Tavg Channel IV were replaced due to <br />the failure. For the post maintenance test, functional tests were performed. The reactor <br />protection system [El IS: JC] is sensitive to the input of the test equipment used for <br />checking/calibrating the system. The functional test stated that two different models of digital <br />multi-meters (DMMs) [El IS: MTR] (or equivalent) could be used for the calibration. Both of the <br />identified devices have an input impedance of 10 giga-ohms. <br />l&C maintenance personnel used an equivalent digital multi-meter (Fluke 8845A DMM) during <br />the performance of the functional tests. This meter can be configured for an input impedance of <br />10 giga-ohms; however, it defaults to 10 mega-ohms. l&C maintenance personnel were <br />unaware of the meter's default setting. As a result, Delta-T/Tavg Channel IV was adjusted <br />incorrectly and the channel returned to service on June 25 at 0215. Unit 1 exited TS 3.3.1 <br />Conditions A and E due to Delta-T/Tavg Channel IV being declared operable. <br />On June 27, 2016, Reactor Engineering was trending certain parameters and noticed that Tavg <br />had taken a step change lower by approximately 2 degrees following the digital filter processor <br />card replacement. In order to validate the channel was functioning correctly, on June 29, 2016, <br />operators authorized performance of a functional test for Delta-T/Tavg Channel IV and Unit 1 <br />entered TS 3.3.1 Conditions A and E. During the functional test Delta-T/Tavg was found to be <br />out of TS tolerance. Following adjustment, on June 29 at 2205, operators declared Delta-T/Tavg <br />Channel IV operable. <br />Page 2 of 7 <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />1. FACILITY NAME 6. LER NUMBER 2.

From Table 3.3.1-1, Function 6 <br />(OTDT), this is Condition E. TS 3.3.1, Condition E, Required Action E.1 allows 72 hours to place <br />one inoperable channel in the tripped condition or Required Action E.2 allows 78 hours to be in <br />Mode 3. A past operability evaluation completed on July 14, 2016, determined Channel IV of the <br />OTDT trip function was in a noncompliance state from June 25, 2016, at 0215 to June 29, 2016 <br />at 2205. Because the inoperable channel was taken out of the tripped condition and in a <br />condition of noncompliance for approximately 115 hours, this is a condition prohibited by TS and <br />is therefore being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), as any operation or <br />condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications. <br />B. Status of structures, components, or systems that were inoperable at the start of the event <br />and contributed to the event: <br />Two digital filter processor cards associated with Delta-T/Tavg Channel IV were replaced <br />due to a failure of one card. For the post maintenance test, functional tests were <br />performed. During performance of the post maintenance testing, Delta-T/Tavg Channel IV <br />was adjusted incorrectly and subsequently returned to service. <br />C. Dates and approximate times of occurrences: <br />Date/Time (EDT) Description <br />06/23/16, 2015 Main control room operators received an unexpected annunciator for, <br />"Protection Set Channel Set Failure." <br />06/24/16, 0100 l&C maintenance personnel identified the digital filter processor circuit <br />card was the cause of the alarm. This affected Delta-T/Tavg Channel IV <br />associated with the OTDT trip function. Unit 1 entered Technical <br />Specification 3.3.1 Conditions A and E for an inoperable channel of the <br />OTDT trip function. <br />06/24/16, 2358 A channel calibration was performed to return the Delta-T/Tavg <br />Channel IV instrument to operable status following digital filter processor <br />card replacement. <br />06/25/16, 0215 Unit 1 exited TS 3.3.1 Conditions A and E due to Delta-T/Tavg Channel IV <br />being declared operable. However, operators were unaware that during <br />the channel calibration, Delta-T/Tavg Channel IV was made inoperable <br />due to an improper calibration. Upon exiting TS 3.3.1 Condition E and no <br />longer maintaining Channel IV of the OTDT trip function in a tripped <br />condition, Unit 1 was no longer complying with TS 3.3.1 Condition E. <br />06/27/16 Reactor Engineering identified that Tavg had taken a step change lower <br />by approximately 2 degrees following the digital filter processor card <br />replacement. <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />1.

Automatically and manually initiated safety system responses: <br />There were no automatic or manual system responses associated with this event. <br />III. CAUSE OF THE EVENT <br />A. The cause of each component or system failure or personnel error, if known: <br />The cause of the event was l&C maintenance personnel were not trained with the operation of <br />the Fluke 8845A DMM. <br />B. The cause(s) and circumstances for each human performance related root cause: <br />l&C maintenance personnel lacked knowledge regarding the default lower internal impedance <br />setting required on the Fluke 8854A DMM. This lack of knowledge was due to several factors <br />including: <br />• maintenance personnel being unfamiliar with the task being performed. <br />• the measuring and test equipment (M&TE) normally used for the calibration was offsite. <br />• the note on the issue ticket for the M&TE regarding impedance could have been missed by <br />maintenance personnel during shift turnover (the equipment had been issued the previous <br />shift). <br />• this was the only M&TE Fluke 8845A DMM (out of 10) with internal impedance not labeled on <br />the actual equipment. <br />• there was no guidance in the procedure to inform the technician on meter set up due to its <br />lower internal impedance setting, or that it was required. <br />IV. ANALYSIS OF THE EVENT <br />The Reactor Trip System (RTS) initiates a unit shutdown based on the values of selected unit <br />parameters, to protect against violating the core fuel design limits and Reactor Coolant System (RCS) <br />pressure boundary during anticipated operational occurrences and to assist the Engineered Safety <br />Features (ESF) Systems in mitigating accidents. <br />The OTDT trip function is provided to ensure that the design limit departure from nucleate boiling ratio <br />(DNBR) is met. This trip function also limits the range over which the OTDT trip function must provide <br />protection. The inputs to the OTDT trip include pressurizer pressure, reactor coolant temperature, <br />axial power distribution, and reactor power as indicated by loop delta-T assuming full reactor coolant <br />flow. Protection from violating the DNBR limit is assured for those transients that are slow with <br />respect to delays from the core to the measurement system. The function monitors both variation in <br />power and flow since a decrease in flow has the same effect on delta-T as a power increase. The <br />OTDT trip function uses each loop's delta-T as a measure of reactor power and is compared with a <br />setpoint that is automatically varied with reactor coolant average temperature, pressurizer pressure, <br />and axial power distribution. There are four OTDT channels arranged in a two-out-of-four logic. The <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />1. FACILITY NAME 6. LER NUMBER 2.

A trip signal from any two <br />channels will generate a reactor trip. Therefore, with Channel IV inoperable and assuming one of the <br />other three channels inoperable, the two remaining channels would still provide the trip function. <br />V. 	 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES <br />Based on the above Analysis of Event and the ability of the RTS to still provide the trip function <br />with the remaining operable OTDT channels, the health and safety of the public was not <br />adversely affected by this event. Additionally, according to probabilistic risk analysis, there <br />was a negligible increase in risk to the plant with the failure of a single protection set. <br />A. Availability of systems or components that could have performed the same function as the <br />components and systems that failed during the event: <br />The OTDT trip signal is an input into the Solid State Protection System (SSPS). SSPS <br />contains the trip logic. For OTDT, the reactor trip logic function is two out of four. A trip <br />signal from any two channels will generate a reactor trip. Therefore, with Channel IV <br />inoperable and assuming one of the other three channels inoperable, the two remaining <br />channels would still provide the trip function. <br />B. For events that occurred when the reactor was shut down, availability of systems or <br />components needed to shutdown the reactor and maintain safe shutdown conditions, <br />remove residual heat, control the release of radioactive material, or mitigate the <br />consequences of an accident: <br />The event did not occur when the reactor was shutdown. <br />C. For failure that rendered a train of a safety system inoperable, an estimate of the elapsed <br />time from discovery of the failure until the train was returned to service: <br />The Channel IV OTDT reactor trip function was inoperable and in noncompliance with TS 3.3.1 <br />Condition E from June 25, 2016 at 0215 until June 29, 2016, at 2205 (approximately 115 hours). <br />VI.
