RPS Channel 2 was in bypass and Channel <br />1 was inoperable/tripped due to an existing Reactor Coolant System (RCS) temperature element (RTD) issue. A fuse <br />failure in an input to RPS Channel 4 caused RPS Channel 4 trip on Flux/Delta-Flux/Flow, resulting in the reactor trip. <br />Post trip, the Steam Feedwater Rupture Control System (SFRCS) actuated due to high Steam Generator (SG) 1 level, <br />initiating the Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) System. The cause of the SFRCS actuation was an improper response by the <br />Integrated Control System (ICS) after the reactor trip. ICS Rapid Feedwater Reduction. (RFR) circuit did not actuate and the <br />ICS SG/Reactor Demand Hand/Auto Station transferred from automatic control to manual. <br />Corrective actions include: RPS Channel 4 power failed fuse replaced, RCS RTD replacement next refueling outage, ICS <br />RFR switch,module replaced, ICS Hand/Auto Station modification. This report is being submitted as an event that resulted in <br />automatic actuation of the RPS, and an automatic actuation of AFW per 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(iv) (A). <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />4..

DOCKET NUMBER <br />05000-346 <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />- 001 <br />YEAR <br />2016 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX]. <br />System Description: <br />The Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station (DBNPS) Reactor Protection System (RPS) [JC] initiates a reactor <br />trip to protect against violating the core fuel design limits and the Reactor Coolant System (RCS) [AB] <br />pressure boundary during anticipated operational occurrences. The RPS consists of four separate redundant <br />protection channels that receive inputs of neutron flux, RCS pressure, RCS flow, RCS temperature, Reactor <br />Coolant Pump (RCP) [AB-P] status, and containment pressure. Each protection channel is composed of <br />measurement channels and a reactor trip module. If an RPS instrumentation setpoint is exceeded, a channel <br />trip signal is generated. The generation of any two trip signals in any of the four RPS channels will result in <br />the trip of the reactor. <br />The Steam and Feedwater Line Rupture Control System (SFRCS) [JB] is required to ensure an adequate <br />feedwater supply to remove reactor decay heat during periods when the normal feedwater supply has been <br />lost. The SFRCS is designed to automatically start the Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFW) [BA] in the event <br />of a main steam line break, main feedwater line rupture, a low level in the Steam Generators [AB-SG] or a <br />loss of all four RCPs. The SFRCS is designed to automatically isolate the Main Steam System (MS) [SB] and <br />Main Feedwater System (MFW) [SJ] in the event of a main steam line break or main feedwater line rupture. <br />The AFW is automatically aligned to feed the unaffected steam generator upon a loss of steam pressure in <br />one of the steam generators. Although not a safety function, the SFRCS also isolates MFW to the Steam <br />Generators and initiates AFW to their respective Steam Generators in the event of high steam generator <br />level. This is to prevent a steam generator overfill condition and subsequent spill over into the main steam <br />lines and main turbine; which could cause thermal shock of steam generator internal structures, and could <br />challenge the integrity of steam line piping and supports caused by excessive main feedwater addition. This <br />high steam generator level trip isolates the Main Steam Isolation Valves (MSIVs) [SB-ISV] to prevent damage <br />to downstream plant equipment. <br />The Integrated Control System (ICS) [JA] provides for coordination of the reactor, steam generator feedwater <br />control, and turbine under all operating conditions. This coordination consists of producing the best load <br />response to the unit load demand while recognizing the capabilities and limitations of the reactor, steam <br />generator feedwater system, and turbine. When any single portion of the station is at an operating limit or a <br />control section is on manual, the integrated control system uses the limited or manual section as a load <br />reference. One of the features of the ICS Feedwater Subsystem is a Rapid Feedwater Reduction (RFR) <br />scheme. The RFR scheme is designed to prevent refeeding the steam generators with feedwater when not <br />warranted, which could cause a primary system (RCS) overcooling transient. The RFR circuitry provides for <br />a rapid decrease in feedwater flow rate after a reactor trip and is also designed to preclude low steam <br />generator level SFRCS actuations resulting from undershoot of the low level control limits. After a reactor <br />trip, with all feedwater stations in automatic, an RFR demand signal equivalent to approximately four (4) 	 • <br />percent of total feedwater flow is substituted for valve position. <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours. <br />Reported lessons learned are incorporated into the licensing process and fed back to industry. <br />Send comments regarding burden estimate to the FOIA, Privacy and Information Collections <br />Branch (T-5 F53), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, or <br />by Internet e-mail to Infocollects.Resource@nrc.gov, and to the Desk Officer, Office of <br />Information and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB-10202, (3150-0104), Office of Management and <br />Budget, Washington, DC 20503.

With one RPS channel inoperable, Condition A requires <br />the channel be placed in bypass or trip within one hour. With two channels inoperable, Condition B requires <br />one channel be placed in trip and the second channel be placed in bypass within one hour. If the Required <br />Action and associated Completion Time of Condition A or B are not met while in Mode 1, Conditions C and D <br />require the unit be in Mode 3 within 6 hours along with the Control Rod Drive (CRD) trip breakers being <br />opened for the applicable RPS functions. <br />DESCRIPTION OF EVENT: <br />On January 29, 2016, the DBNPS was operating in Mode 1 at approximately 100 percent power. Power <br />Range Nuclear Instrumentation (NI) calibrations were being performed in accordance with TS Surveillance <br />Requirements. Due to an existing issue that rendered RPS Channel 1 inoperable as discussed below, RPS <br />Channel 1 was placed in a tripped status at 1214 hours after calibration of NI 6 was complete to support <br />calibration of NIs 5, 7, and 8 in the other RPS Channels. At 1309 hours, RPS Channel 2 was placed in <br />Bypass to perform calibration of NI 5. At 1322 hours, a failure occurred in the RCS Flow input to RPS <br />Channel 4. With Channel 1 in trip, this failure satisfied the RPS logic and caused RPS Channel 4 to trip on <br />Flux/Delta-Flux/Flow, tripping the reactor. <br />Initial unit response to the reactor trip was as designed, and all control rods fully inserted. Following the <br />reactor trip, as the control room operators were progressing through the post-trip procedure steps, they <br />observed Steam Generator levels rising due to a failure of the ICS to properly respond to the reactor trip. The <br />operators took manual control of Loop 1 feedwater and attempted to reduce main feedwater flOw, <br />approximately one minute after the reactor trip. However, SFRCS actuated on high Steam Generator 1 level <br />as level reached the 220 inch setpoint. All SFRCS components responded as designed, with both Auxiliary <br />Feedwater Pump Turbines starting, both MSIVs closing, and isolating the Main Feedwater System. <br />Additional equipment anomalies noted following the trip included: 1) Generator Output Breaker ACB34560 <br />opened as designed on the trip with Generator Output Breaker ACB34561 failing to open quick enough <br />(approximately 8 cycles), which led to the subsequent opening of switchyard breaker 34562 and de-<br />energization of the Bayshore Line input to the switchyard (the other three offsite lines to the switchyard <br />remained energized throughout the event, providing power to the two Startup Transformers, therefore, offsite <br />power was not challenged throughout the event). 2) Main Steam Safety Valves (MSSV) [SB-RV] on both <br />Main Steam lines were observed to not fully reseat following the reactor trip (Operators lowered Steam <br />Generator pressures in accordance with procedures in order to allow the valves to reseat, and the Plant was <br />stable in Mode 3 with the AFW System providing AFW to the SGs, as designed). <br />CAUSE OF EVENT: <br />The first direct cause and the root cause of the reactor trip was the spurious failure of fuse Y414 providing <br />power to RPS Channel 4. The loss, of power caused cabinet C5756G to de-energize, which contains two <br />modules that provide RCS flow input to RPS Channel 4 (FYRC1A4 and FYRC1B4). When these two <br />modules lost power, the signals failed low, causing RPS Channel 4 to trip on Flux / Delta-Flux / Flow. A <br />review of industry experience identified potential causes attributed to the manufacture and design of the fuse <br />element: intergranular tearing of the fuse element which reduces the current carrying potential, and <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET 	 j  <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours. <br />Reported lessons learned are incorporated into the licensing process and fed back to industry. <br />Send comments regarding burden estimate to the FOIA, Privacy and Information Collections <br />Branch (T-5 F53), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, or <br />by internet e-mail to Infocollects.Resource@nrc.gov, and to the Desk Officer, Office of <br />Information and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB-10202, (3150-0104), Office of Management and <br />Budget, Washington, DC 20503.

DOCKET NUMBER <br />05000-346 <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />- 001 <br />YEAR <br />2016 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />00 <br />CAUSE OF EVENT: (continued) <br />weakening due to initial in-rush current; both of which can result in fuse failure during normal operations. <br />The second direct cause of the reactor trip was continued plant operation with RPS Channel 1 inoperable <br />due to the failure of temperature element TERC3B2 monitoring RCS Loop 1 Hot Leg Narrow Range <br />Temperature. Operating with RPS Channel 1 inoperable requires placing the channel in bypass and tripping <br />the channel when it is required to be removed from bypass. RPS Channel 1 was removed from bypass and <br />placed in trip status on January 29, 2016 to allow performance of NI calibrations in the other 3 channels of • <br />RPS. When Fuse Y414 failed, the 2 of 4 trip logic for RPS was completed, and the reactor trip was initiated. <br />A contributing cause to the reactor trip was a deficient trend evaluation of failures of the A25X series fuse, <br />such as was installed in Y414. Preventive Maintenance (PM) activities were created with a 15-year <br />periodicity to replace the A25X10 (10 amp) and A25X15 (15 amp) fuses. Spurious failures of these fuses <br />continued to occur following these periodic replacements. However, evaluation of the trend did not <br />recognize that the PM frequency was not adequate to prevent failures. <br />The first direct cause of the failure of the ICS to properly respond to the reactor trip was due to the failure o,f <br />the RFR circuitry to actuate, which was due to an ICS module not being properly wired for the installed <br />application. In 1990, an ICS module that was used as the Borate Control Switch was removed by a <br />modification and sent to the warehouse for later use. During the most recent refueling outage in 2014, this <br />ICS module was obtained from the warehouse and installed in the ICS functional location for the RFR Defeat <br />Switch. Because the module wiring was not properly wired for this installation, the RFR Defeat Switch <br />prevented the RFR circuitry from actuating even though it was in the ON position. <br />The second direct cause of the failure of the ICS to properly respond to the reactor trip was due to the Steam <br />Generator/Reactor Demand Hand/Auto,station transferring to Hand following the trip of the Main Turbine. If <br />the ICS station would have remained in automatic, it would have reduced feedwater demand quickly enough <br />to prevent reaching the SFRCS high level trip setpoint. The cause of the Hand/Auto station transferring to <br />hand was an ineffective software change. Changes were made to the ICS during the 2014 refueling outage <br />to improve control of the Unit Load Demand circuitry. However, these changes inadvertently introduced a <br />new failure mode that caused the Hand/Auto station to transfer to hand whenever a large and rapid change in <br />generated megawatts occurred, such as would occur during a reactor or turbine trip. This failure mode was <br />identified while performing training scenarios on the simulator following the 2014 refueling outage, but the <br />software change made in December 2015 to correct the failure mode was not successful. <br />The first root cause of the failure of the ICS to properly respond to the reactor trip was due to inadequate <br />work package instructions for performing a bench check of the replacement ICS module, as they did not <br />ensure the bench check adequately tested the module's intended function. A continuity check was performed <br />followed by toggling the switch on and off ten times and then rechecking continuity to ensure the switch <br />resistance had not increased. However, the bench check did not validate the switch position with the contact <br />state of the output pins per the vendor manual or ICS drawing, and therefore did not verify the RFR switch <br />was properly wired for the toggle ON position. <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours. <br />Reported lessons learned are incorporated into the licensing process and fed back to industry. <br />Send comments regarding burden estimate to the FOIA, Privacy and Information Collections <br />Branch (1-5 F53), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, or <br />by Internet e-mail to Infocollects.Resource@nrc.gov, and to the Desk Officer, Office of <br />Information and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB-10202, (3150-0104), Office of Management and <br />Budget, Washington, DC 20503.

A subsequent fix to this new failure mode did not <br />quantify available operating margin or account for additional delay in the signal processing hardware, <br />resulting in the change being ineffective when installed in the plant. The procedural guidance for making life <br />cycle changes to in-house software was less than adequate for ensuring changes do not introduce new <br />failure modes and documenting the basis for design and testing. <br />ANALYSIS OF EVENT: <br />With RPS Channel 1 inoperable and tripped due to the existing RTD issue and the in-progress NI calibrations <br />for RPS Channel 2 requiring Channel 2 to be in bypass; when fuse Y414 spuriously failed, the 2 out of 4 trip <br />logic for RPS was satisfied and the reactor trip was initiated. The control rods inserted fully as designed. <br />Post-trip, the SFRCS actuated due to high SG 1 level. All SFRCS components responded as designed, with <br />both AFW Pump Turbines starting, both MSIVs closing, and isolating the MFW System. <br />Due to the demands on and priorities of the control room operators following a reactor trip, they would not be <br />expected to identify and correct this improper response of the ICS within the short time period (approximately <br />60 seconds) available. <br />As noted above, two ICS anomalies occurred immediately after the reactor trip, which resulted in the SG 1 <br />High Level trip. The first anomaly was the ICS RFR circuit did not function. The second anomaly was that <br />the Steam Generator/Reactor Demand Hand/Auto Station transferred from Auto to Manual, which held the <br />ICS Feedwater Demand Signal high. The combination of these two anomalies resulted in an increase in SG <br />1 level to the SFRCS high level setpoint. If either SG/RX Demand would have remained in Auto or RFR had <br />fired, the SFRCS SG High level actuation would not have occurred. As discussed previously, the conditions <br />leading to the ICS anomalies were found to have been in existence since the refueling outage in 2014 (i.e., <br />greater than one year, which results in the incremental conditional core damage probability (ICCDP) for this <br />period of 1.87E-06). <br />Investigation has shown that any Reactor/Turbine trip from 100 percent power while these conditions existed <br />would have resulted in an SFRCS Isolation trip on high level that would effectively cause a loss of Main <br />Feedwater. <br />When performance of a bounding quantitative evaluation was performed, using best available information to <br />determine the significance of the event, the delta Core Damage Frequency (CDF) was estimated to be 1.87E-<br />6/yr which is considered to be low to moderate safety significance. Because the delta CDF for this event was <br />determined to be greater than 1E-7/yr, a screening was conducted using the Large Early Release Frequency <br />(LERF) screening criteria to assess whether any of the core damage sequences that were affected by the <br />finding are potential LERF contributors. Evaluations of the external events were estimated to be: (Fire — delta <br />CDF 1.94E-6/yr, low to moderate safety significance and seismic — no risk increase, very low safety <br />significance), and delta LERF was estimated to be: (3.3E-8/yr, very low safety significance). <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours. <br />Reported lessons learned are incorporated into the licensing process and fed back to industry. <br />Send comments regarding burden estimate to the FOIA, Privacy and Information Collections <br />Branch (T-5 F53), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, or <br />by intemet e-mail to Infocollects.Resource@nrc.gov, and to the Desk Officer, Office of <br />Information and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB-10202, (3150-0104), Office of Management and <br />Budget, Washington, DC 20503: If a means used to impose an information collection does <br />not display a currently valid OMB control number, the NRC may not conduct or sponsor, <br />and a person is not required to respond to, the information collection. <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />3.

DOCKET NUMBER <br />05000-346 <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />- 001 <br />YEAR <br />2016 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />00 <br />Reportability Discussion: <br />The automatic actuation of the RPS while the reactor is critical is reportable within four hours of occurrence <br />per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B). The actuation of the Auxiliary Feedwater System by the Steam Feedwater <br />Rupture Control System (SFRCS) on a valid high Steam Generator level is reportable within eight hours of <br />the event in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A). On January 29, 2016, at 1643 hours both of these <br />events were reported to the NRC Operations Center (Event Number 51696). <br />These issues are being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), which requires reporting of <br />any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of the RPS, including a reactor scram or <br />reactor trip, as well as automatic actuation of the Auxiliary Feedwater System. All safety systems performed <br />as required to the event, and no loss of safety function occurred. <br />CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: <br />The following corrective actions have been or will be taken in response to the reactor trip: <br />The failed fuse Y414 as well as the associated power supply were replaced on January 30, 2016, to support <br />plant restart. <br />TERC3B2 will be repaired in the next refueling outage, scheduled to commence March 26, 2016, to restore <br />RPS Channel 1 to operable status. <br />A set of A25X series fuses will be replaced with KAB fuses during the upcoming refueling outage, and the <br />removed A25X series fuses will be sent to a laboratory for analysis to determine if the cause of the fuse <br />failures can be verified. <br />The existing stock of A25X series fuses rated at 30 amperes or less have been discarded, and as an interim <br />measure only KAB or A30QS Series fuses will be utilized for replacements going forward. For A25X series <br />fuses rated at 40 amperes or greater, no actions are recommended because these higher rated fuses are a <br />different style than the lower amperage fuses, do not supply power to essential cabinets, and have not <br />experienced spurious failures. An Engineering Change Package will be developed to replace the A25X <br />series of fuses. <br />The following corrective actions have beers or will be taken in response to the failure of the ICS to properly <br />respond to the reactor trip: <br />The ICS Module improperly wired for the RFR Defeat Switch Module was replaced with a module that was <br />bench checked to verify it performed. its intended function prior to plant restart. The removed module was <br />tagged to ensure it would not be used. A data package was also created for this module which provided <br />guidance for proper bench checking the module. <br />The design of the Megawatt-generated output signal and feedback signal delta alarm logic will be reviewed to <br />prevent the Steam Generator/Reactor Demand Station from going to Hand inadvertently, and the circuitry will <br />be modified accordingly. In the interim, Operators have a contingency action to place SG/RX Demand back <br />in Auto if the anomaly reoccurs. <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours. <br />Reported lessons learned are incorporated into the licensing process and fed back to industry. <br />Send comments regarding burden estimate to the FOIA, Privacy and Information Collections <br />Branch (T-5 F53), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, or <br />by intemet e-mail to Infocollects.Resource@nrc.gov, and to the Desk Officer, Office of <br />Information and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB-10202, (3150-0104), Office of Management and <br />Budget, Washington, DC 20503.

LER 2015-<br />002 documents the manual actuation of RPS to manually trip the reactor, and a manual initiation of SFRCS <br />in response to a steam leak in the turbine building. There have been no similar LERs at the DBNPS <br />involving an automatic actuation of the RPS, or automatic actuation of the SFRCS due to high steam <br />generator level in the past three years. <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015)<br /></span>
