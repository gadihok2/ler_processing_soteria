These activities are prohibited by Technical Specifications (TS) <br />3.6.4.1. However, recent NRC guidance provided in Enforcement Guidance Memorandum (EGM) 11-003, Revision 3 <br />and in Regulatory Issue Summary (RIS) 2012-11 allowed the implementation of interim actions as an alternative to full <br />compliance. These actions are compiled in the operating procedure for the OPDRV activities performed during the <br />2016 Hatch Unit 1 Refueling Outage in February. <br />The performance of OPDRV activities were planned activities that were completed under the guidance of plant <br />procedures and confirmed to have low safety significance based on interim actions taken. Since these actions were <br />deliberate, no cause determination was necessary. A licensee amendment request (LAR) will be submitted following <br />NRC approval of the Technical Specification Task Force (TSTF) Traveler associated with generic resolution of this <br />issue (TSTF-542). <br />NRC FORM 366 (02-2014) <br />NRC FORM 366A (1-2001) <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 1/31/2017 <br />(02-2014) Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request 80 hours <br />".0 RCN,. <br />f ,1 <br />Reported lessons learned are Incorporated into the licensing process and fed back to industry <br />Send comments regarding burden estimate to the FOIA, Privacy and Information Collections ) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) ChgovmmandtohirDeshil79 OthlfiCen DCr Offic2BB5e of Inform hratirn iBntemeht ge--m5:153to)infot HectsNuclear Regourceula:nryrc.  <br />, 	 / 	 CONTINUATION SHEET and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB-10202, (3150-0194), Office of Management and Budget.

Hatch Nuclear Plant Unit 1 05000 321 <br />NUMBER NO. <br />2 OF 3 <br />2016 — 002 — 00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />PLANT AND SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION <br />General Electric- Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) <br />Energy Industry Identification System codes appear in the text as (EIIS Code XX) <br />DESCRIPTION OF EVENT <br />In February 2016, with Unit 1 at 0 percent rated thermal power due to a scheduled refueling outage, operations with the <br />potential to drain the reactor vessel (OPDRV) activities were performed while in Mode 5 (Refueling Mode) contrary to <br />Technical Specification (TS) 3.6.4.1. The NRC recognizes that such activities need to be performed during refueling <br />outages. Activities are underway to formulate acceptable generic changes to BWR Technical Specifications. NRC <br />Regulatory Issue Summary (RIS) 2012-11 communicated this guidance to the industry. Enforcement Guidance <br />Memorandum (EGM) 11-003, Revision 3 currently provides enforcement discretion for licensee noncompliance with TS <br />containment requirements during OPDRV activities until December 31, 2017 while the NRC staff and Boiling Water <br />Reactor Owner's Group finalize a generic solution for TS changes. The required interim actions specified in the EGM <br />were incorporated into plant procedure 31GO-OPS-025-0 "Operations With The Potential To Drain The Reactor Vessel". <br />This procedure was utilized during the following three occasions during the 2016 Unit 1 Refueling Outage: <br />Table 1: Hatch Unit 1 OPDRVs Performed February 2016 <br />OPDRV Activity Start End <br />LPRM replacement activity 02/13/2016, 2130 EST 02/15/2016, 0149 EST <br />CRD push-pull activity 02/15/2016, 1213 EST 02/16/2016, 0740 EST <br />CRD insert / re-couple activity 02/17/2016, 1547 EST 02/18/2016, 1038 EST <br />CAUSE OF EVENT <br />Implementation of the required EGM 11-003, Revision 3 interim actions during the 2016 Unit 1 Refueling Outage was <br />a planned activity. As such, no cause determination was performed for the events. <br />REPORT ABILITY AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT <br />This event is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation or condition prohibited by Technical <br />Specifications (TS) 3.6.4.1.C.3, which prohibits performing activities identified as OPDRVs in Mode 5 while secondary <br />containment is inoperable. <br />The OPDRVs discussed in this report performed during the Unit 2 Refueling Outage were accomplished using interim <br />actions provided by the NRC in EGM 11-003, Revision 3. Hatch adhered to the NRC plain language meaning of <br />OPDRV activities that could potentially result in draining or siphoning the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) water level <br />below the top of the fuel. Hatch also met the requirements which specify the minimum makeup flow rate and water <br />inventory based on OPDRV activities with long drain down times. <br />1. FACILITY NAME 3. PAGE 2. DOCKET 6.

Since these compensatory <br />measures were properly implemented, an adequate level of safety was provided during the performance of the OPDVR <br />activities described in this report Based on this information, the performance of these OPDRV activities were determined <br />to have a very low safety significance. <br />CORRECTIVE ACTIONS <br />Consistent with the guidance given in EGM 11-003 Revision 3, Hatch will submit a licensee amendment request (LAR) <br />following NRC approval of the Technical Specifications Task Force (TSTF) Traveler associated with generic resolution <br />of this issue within the time restraints given in the EGM. <br />ADDITIONAL INFORMATION  <br />Other Systems Affected: None. <br />Failed Components Information: None. <br />Commitment Information: This report does not created any new licensing commitments. <br />Previous Similar Events: <br />LER 2015-002-00 <br />On February 16, 2015, February 20, February 18 through 19, 2015, and February 23 through 24, 2015, OPDRV <br />activities were performed while Unit 2 was in Refueling Mode (Mode 5) without an operable secondary containment <br />These activities are prohibited by Technical Specifications (TS) 3.6.4.1. However, NRC guidance provided in <br />Regulatory Issue Summary (RIS) 2012-11 and in Enforcement Guidance Memorandum (EGM) 11-003, Revision 2 <br />allowed the implementation of interim actions as an alternative to full compliance. An adequate defensed in depth <br />was maintained to minimize the potential for the release of fission products with secondary containment not operable <br />by (a) monitoring RPV level to identify the onset of a loss of inventory event, (b) maintaining the capability to isolate <br />the potential leakage paths, (c) prohibiting Mode 4 (cold shutdown) OPDRV activities, and (d) prohibiting the <br />movement of irradiated fuel with the spent fuel storage pool gates removed in Mode 5. The associated Technical <br />Specification Task Force (TSTF) Traveler is not yet available as a Technical Specification consolidated line item <br />improvement process (CLIIP) for use by licensees. For that reason, the corrective actions from this event would not <br />be expected to have prevented the condition reported in this LER. <br />NRC FORM 366A (02-2014)<br /></span>
