Consistent with EGM 11-003, Revision 3, secondary containment operability was not maintained during <br />Operations with a Potential for Draining the Reactor Vessel (OPDRV) activities, and Required Actions C.1 and C.2 of <br />Technical Specification (TS) 3.6.4.1, "Secondary Containment," were not completed. EGM 11-003, Revision 3, was <br />implemented four additional times during the 2016, Unit 1 refueling outage. These conditions are being reported in <br />accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as operations prohibited by the plant's TSs. <br />Implementation of EGM 11-003, Revision 3, during the Unit 1 refueling outage was a planned activity. As such, there <br />was no root cause evaluation of the event. Consistent with the guidance provided in EGM 11-003, Revision 3, BSEP <br />will submit a license amendment request to adopt a Technical Specification Task Force (TSTF) traveler associated <br />with generic resolution of this issue within 12 months after the issuance of the Notice of Availability of the TSTF <br />traveler. <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />.1 LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

Consistent with EGM 11-003, Revision 3, secondary containment [NG] operability was not <br />maintained during Operations with a Potential for Draining the Reactor Vessel (OPDRV) activities, and Required <br />Actions C.1 and C.2 of Technical Specification (TS) 3.6.4.1, "Secondary Containment," were not completed. EGM11-<br />003, Revision 3, was implemented four additional times during the 2016, Unit 1 refueling outage. These conditions <br />are being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as operations prohibited by the plant's TSs. <br />Event Description  <br />On January 15, 2016, the NRC issued EGM 11-003, Revision 3. EGM 11-003, Revision 3, provides generic <br />enforcement discretion to allow implementation of specific interim actions as an alternative to full compliance with <br />plant TSs related to secondary containment operability during Mode 5 OPDRV activities. To ensure compliance with <br />the interim actions specified in the EGM, BSEP developed plant procedure 1SP-16-100, "Unit 1 EGM 11-003 <br />OPDRV Activities." This procedure, which implements compensatory actions that meet or exceed those specified in <br />EGM 11-003, Revision 3, was implemented on five occasions during the 2016, Unit 1 refueling outage. The following <br />list provides the durations of each period during which EGM 11-003, Revision 3, was implemented (i.e., OPDRV <br />activities were in progress with secondary containment inoperable). Unit 1 was in Mode 5 during these periods. <br />EGM 11-003, Revision 3 <br />Implementation Duration 	 Start 	 End <br />1 hour, 19 minutes <br />2 days, 2 hours, 56 minutes <br />2 days, 8 hours, 20 minutes <br />18 hours, 40 minutes <br />3 days, 1 hour, 20 minutes <br />March 9, 2016, at 1257 <br />Eastern Standard Time (EST) <br />March 9, 2016, at 1419 EST <br />March 11, 2016, at 1915 EST <br />March 14, 2016, at 2035 EDT <br />March 15, 2016, at 2010 EDT <br />March 9, 2016, at 1416 EST <br />March 11, 2016, at 1715 EST <br />March 14, 2016, at 0345 <br />Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) <br />March 15, 2016, at 1515 EDT <br />March 18, 2016, at 2130 EDT <br />Page 2 of 3 <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

LER NUMBER <br />Brunswick Steam Electric Plant (BSEP) <br />Unit 1 <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />003 <br />05000-325 <br />YEAR <br />2016 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />- 000 <br />NARRATIVE <br />Event Causes  <br />Implementation of EGM 11-003, Revision 3, during the Unit 1 refueling outage was a planned activity. As such, there <br />was no root cause evaluation of the event. <br />Safety Assessment <br />The safety significance of this event is minimal. As discussed in EGM 11-003, Revision 3, enforcement discretion <br />related to secondary containment operability during Mode 5 OPDRV activities is appropriate because the associated <br />interim actions necessary to receive the discretion ensure an adequate level of safety. To ensure compliance with the <br />interim actions specified in the EGM, BSEP developed plant procedure 1SP-16-100. This procedure was <br />implemented for the OPDRV activities during which secondary containment was not operable. <br />Corrective Actions <br />BSEP will submit a license amendment request to adopt a Technical Specification Task Force (TSTF) traveler <br />associated with generic resolution of this issue within 12 months after the issuance of the Notice of Availability of the <br />TSTF traveler. <br />Previous Similar Events <br />A review of LERs for the past three years identified the following previous similar occurrences. <br />• LER 2-2015-001, dated April 24, 2015, reported implementation of EGM 11-003 during the 2015 Unit 2 <br />refueling outage. The corrective action for LER 2-2015-001 was to submit a license amendment request to <br />adopt a TSTF traveler associated with generic resolution of this issue within 12 months after the issuance <br />of the Notice of Availability of the TSTF traveler. To date, there is not an approved TSTF traveler. As such, <br />the corrective action from LER 2-2015-001 could not be implemented and could not have prevented the <br />condition reported in LER 1-2016-003. <br />• LER 1-2014-001, dated May 1, 2014, reported implementation of EGM 11-003 during the 2014 Unit 1 <br />refueling outage. The corrective action for LER 1-2014-001 was to submit a license amendment request to <br />adopt a TSTF traveler associated with generic resolution of this issue within 12 months after the issuance <br />of the Notice of Availability of the TSTF traveler. To date, there is not an approved TSTF traveler. As such, <br />the corrective action from LER 1-2014-001 could not be implemented and could not have prevented the <br />condition reported in LER 1-2016-003. <br />• LER 2-2013-001, dated May 6, 2013, reported implementation of EGM 11-003 during the 2013 Unit 2 <br />refueling outage. The corrective action for LER 2-2013-001 was to submit a license amendment request to <br />adopt a TSTF traveler associated with generic resolution of this issue within four months after the issuance <br />of the Notice of Availability of the TSTF traveler. To date, there is not an approved TSTF traveler. As such, <br />the corrective action from LER 2-2013-001 could not be implemented and could not have prevented the <br />condition reported in LER 1-2016-003. <br />Commitments <br />No regulatory commitments are contained in this report. <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />Page 3 of 3 <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015)<br /></span>
