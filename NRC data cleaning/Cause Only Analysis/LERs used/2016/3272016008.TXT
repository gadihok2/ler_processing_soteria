PLANT OPERATING CONDITIONS BEFORE THE EVENT <br />At the time of the event, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Unit 1 and Unit 2 were in Mode 1 at <br />100 percent rated thermal power. <br />II. DESCRIPTION OF EVENTS <br />A. Event: <br />On August 10, 2016, at 1000 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT),the Maintenance Instrument Group <br />(MIG) began performing a surveillance instruction (SI) associated with a functional test of the fire <br />detection system [EllS: IC] and peripheral devices. During performance of the SI, MIG received <br />the expected response from the test, which was an alarm [EllS: ALM]. Multiple times during the <br />test, MIG was instructed by the SI to acknowledge the alarm (by pressing the "send" key) and <br />continue with testing. At some point during performance of the SI, a fire protection damper [EllS: <br />DMP] associated with the Control Room Emergency Ventilation System (CREVS) [EllS: VI] <br />received an actuation signal and actuated to a closed position. While closing, the damper <br />actuator broke its associated fusible links, as designed. This was not an anticipated result of the <br />SI, and therefore, went undiscovered. <br />On August 11, 2016, at 1015 EDT, while performing a walkdown of the Relay Room, the fire <br />protection damper was discovered in the closed position. The closure resulted in both trains of <br />CREVS being inoperable due to the loss of air circulation and habitability of the Technical <br />Support Center (TSC) and Relay Room. Both units entered Technical Specification (TS) Limiting <br />Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.7.10, Conditions A and G. Condition G requires immediate <br />entry into LCO 3.0.3. At 1159 EDT, on August 11, actions were taken to block open the fire <br />damper and both trains of CREVS were declared operable. This allowed both units to exit <br />LCO 3.0.3 and LCO 3.7.10, Conditions A and G. <br />An 8-hour non-emergency event notification (EN 52172) was made to the NRC in accordance <br />with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(xiii), as any event that results in a major loss of emergency assessment <br />capability, offsite response capability, or offsite communications capability, and <br />10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v)(D), as an event or condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a <br />safety function of structures or systems that are needed to mitigate the consequences of an <br />accident. This LER documents the reportable event under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D). <br />Additionally, it was determined that both trains of CREVS were inoperable from August 10, 2016, <br />at 1000 to August 11, 2016, at 1159. LCO 3.7.10, Condition G, Required Action G.1 requires <br />immediate entry into LCO 3.0.3. LCO 3.0.3 requires the unit to be in MODE 3 within 7 hours and <br />MODE 4 within 13 hours. Because both trains of CREVS were inoperable for approximately <br />26 hours and remained in MODE 1, this is a condition prohibited by TS and is therefore being <br />Page 2 of 6 <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />1.

Status of structures, components, or systems that were inoperable at the start of the event <br />and contributed to the event: <br />No inoperable structures, components, or systems contributed to this event. <br />C. Dates and approximate times of occurrences: <br />Date/Time (EDT) Description <br />08/10/16, 1000 MIG began performance of an SI associated with a functional test of the <br />fire detection system and peripheral devices. During performance of the <br />SI, a fire protection damper associated with the CREVS received an <br />actuation signal and actuated to a closed position. <br />08/10/16, 1400 MIG completed the SI with all acceptance criteria satisfied. <br />08/11/16, 1015 The fire protection damper was discovered in the closed position. The <br />closure resulted in both trains of CREVS being inoperable due to the loss <br />of air circulation and habitability of the Technical Support Center and <br />Relay Room. Both units entered LCO 3.7.10, Conditions A and G and <br />LCO 3.0.3. <br />08/11/16, 1159 The fire protection damper was blocked open and secured in its required <br />position to support the design safety function. This restored both CREVS <br />trains to operable status. Both units exited LCO 3.7.10, Conditions A <br />and G and LCO 3.0.3. <br />D. Manufacturer and model number of each component that failed during the event: <br />There was no component that failed during the event. While closing, the damper actuator broke <br />its associated fusible links, as designed. <br />E. Other systems or secondary functions affected: <br />There were no other systems or secondary functions affected by this event. <br />F. Method of discovery of each component or system failure or procedural error: <br />While performing a walkdown of the Relay Room, the fire protection damper was discovered in <br />the closed position. <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />1.

The failure mode, mechanism, and effect of each failed component, if known: <br />There was no component that failed during the event. While closing, the damper actuator <br />broke its associated fusible links, as designed. <br />H. Operator actions: <br />Both trains of CREVS were declared inoperable due to the loss of air circulation and habitability <br />of the TSC and Relay Room. Both units entered LCO 3.7.10, Conditions A and G and <br />LCO 3.0.3. <br />I. Automatically and manually initiated safety system responses: <br />There were no automatic or manual system responses associated with this event. <br />III. CAUSE OF THE EVENT <br />A. The cause of each component or system failure or personnel error, if known: <br />There was no component or system failure associated with this event. <br />The cause of the event was determined to be inadequate breaker alignment instructions in the <br />SI. Had the associated breaker been open during the SI test, the fire protection damper would <br />not have received an actuation signal and would not have closed. <br />B. The cause(s) and circumstances for each human performance related root cause: <br />There was no identified human performance related root cause. <br />IV. ANALYSIS OF THE EVENT <br />The CREVS provides a protected environment from which occupants can control the unit following an <br />uncontrolled release of radioactivity, hazardous chemicals, or smoke. The CREVS consists of two <br />independent, redundant trains that recirculate and filter the air in the control room envelope (CRE) <br />and a CRE boundary that limits the inleakage of unfiltered air. Each CREVS train consists of a high <br />efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, an activated charcoal adsorber section for removal of gaseous <br />activity (principally iodines), and a fan. Ductwork, valves or dampers, doors, barriers, and <br />instrumentation also form part of the system. <br />The CREVS is an emergency system, parts of which may also operate during normal unit operations <br />in the standby mode of operation. Actuation of the CREVS places the system in the emergency <br />mode of operation. Actuation of the system to the emergency radiation state of the emergency mode <br />of operation, closes the unfiltered outside air intake and unfiltered exhaust dampers, and aligns the <br />system for recirculation of the air within the CRE through the redundant trains of HEPA filters and <br />the charcoal adsorbers. The emergency radiation state also initiates pressurization and filtered <br />ventilation of the air supply to the CRE. <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />1. FACILITY NAME 6. LER NUMBER 2. DOCKET <br />Sequoyah Nuclear Plant Unit 1 05000327 <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER YEAR <br />REV <br />NO. <br />2016 - 008 	 00 <br />Page 5 of 6 <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) 	 LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />NARRATIVE <br />The closed fire protection damper resulted in the CREVS being unable to provide air circulation to the <br />TSC and Relay Room (both rooms are located within the CRE). This could have prevented the TSC <br />from being habitable had plant conditions required activation of the TSC. The event would not have <br />challenged the habitability of the main control room (MCR). <br />V. 	 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES <br />There were no actual safety consequences as a result of this event. Engineering judgment <br />determined the event could have resulted in a slight increase in dose to the MCR operators; <br />however, the dose would have remained below 10 CFR 100 limits. <br />A. Availability of systems or components that could have performed the same function as the <br />components and systems that failed during the event: <br />There were no components or systems that failed during the event. <br />B. For events that occurred when the reactor was shut down, availability of systems or <br />components needed to shutdown the reactor and maintain safe shutdown conditions, <br />remove residual heat, control the release of radioactive material, or mitigate the <br />consequences of an accident: <br />The event did not occur when the reactor was shutdown. <br />C. For failure that rendered a train of a safety system inoperable, an estimate of the elapsed <br />time from discovery of the failure until the train was returned to service: <br />The elapsed time from discovery of both trains of CREVS being inoperable until both trains were <br />restored to operable status was approximately 104 minutes. <br />VI. 	 CORRECTIVE ACTIONS <br />This event was entered into the Tennessee Valley Authority Corrective Action Program under <br />Condition Reports (CR) 1201905. <br />A. Immediate Corrective Actions: <br />Actions were taken to block the fire protection damper in the open position. Additionally to <br />address the extent of condition, actions were taken to inspect other fire protection <br />dampers. <br />B. Corrective actions to reduce probability of similar events occurring in the future: <br />Corrective actions include revising the SI to require the associated breaker to be open <br />prior to performance of the SI. <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />1.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION <br />A. Previous similar events at the same plant: <br />A review of SQN LERs identified an event that resulted in both trains of CREVS being declared <br />inoperable. LER 327/2016-003 reported a condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of <br />a safety function of structures or systems that are needed to mitigate the consequences of an <br />accident when both trains of CREVS were declared inoperable because of an inoperable Control <br />Room Envelope. The cause of the event was the bottom screw in the door latch guard appears <br />to have stripped loose and fallen into the rubber seal around the base of the MCR door frame <br />preventing closure of the door. Additionally, LERs 327/2013-004, 327/2015-001, and <br />328/2015-001 report events associated with procedures. <br />B. Additional Information: <br />None. <br />C. Safety System Functional Failure Consideration: <br />This condition resulted in a safety system functional failure. <br />D. Scrams with Complications Consideration: <br />There was no scram associated with this event. <br />VIII. COMMITMENTS <br />None. <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015)<br /></span>
