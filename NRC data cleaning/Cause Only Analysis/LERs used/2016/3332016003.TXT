The individuals involved each closed their respective doors <br />upon encountering this unexpected condition; however, the result was a brief inoperability of secondary <br />containment. <br />This resulted in an 8 hour reportable event. The Resident Inspector was notified, and an Event Notification was <br />made pursuant to 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v)(C) due to a condition at the time of discovery that prevented the <br />fulfillment of the Secondary Containment safety function (Reference ENS 51985). Following the event, the <br />doors functioned properly, and no deficiencies were noted with either door. <br />There were no radiological releases associated with this event. <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />Page 2 of 3 <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours Reported <br />lessons learned are incorporated into the licensing process and fed back to industry Send comments <br />regarding burden estimate to the FOIA, Privacy and Information Collections Branch (T-5 F53).

LER NUMBER <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />— 003 <br />YEAR <br />2016 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />— 00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />Background <br />The Secondary Containment [EIIS identifier: NG] boundary surrounds the primary containment and refueling <br />equipment. The boundary forms a control volume to contain, dilute, and hold up fission products. The <br />Secondary Containment consists of four systems which include the Reactor Building, the Reactor Building <br />Isolation and Control System, the Standby Gas Treatment System, and the Main Stack. Secondary <br />Containment is designed to provide containment for postulated design basis accident scenarios: loss-of-<br />coolant accident and refueling (fuel handling) accident. Since pressure may increase in Secondary <br />Containment relative to the environmental pressure, support systems are required to maintain a differential <br />pressure vacuum such that external atmosphere would leak into containment rather than fission products leak <br />out. <br />The systems which maintain a differential pressure vacuum inside Secondary Containment include the normal <br />Reactor Building Ventilation and Cooling (RBV) System [VA] (during normal plant operations) and the safety-<br />related Standby Gas Treatment (SBGT) System [BH] for post-accident conditions. <br />Technical Specification (TS) Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.6.4.1.3 requires one Secondary Containment <br />access door in each access opening to remain closed. Failure to meet this SR results in the Secondary <br />Containment Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) not being met, and requires the Secondary Containment <br />to be declared Inoperable. <br />Event Description <br />On June 7, 2016, with the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant (JAF) operating at 100 percent power, <br />members of the Maintenance and Security departments simultaneously entered the northeast Secondary <br />Containment airlock on Reactor Building Elevation 272'. This resulted in the concurrent opening of the airlock <br />doors. This condition was corrected within approximately two (2) seconds. At the time of the closure of either <br />door, secondary containment integrity was restored as the SR for one door closed was met, and no other SRs <br />(such as negative pressure) were being exceeded. <br />For the condition in which Secondary Containment did not meet the Technical Specification (TS) Surveillance <br />Requirement (SR) 3.6.4.1.3 for at least one door in secondary containment access opening being closed, the <br />TS Limiting Condition of Operation (LCO) 3.6.4.1 required action was to restore secondary containment to <br />Operable status in 4 hours. <br />An NRC notification was made via ENS 51985. This Licensing Event Report (LER) is being submitted per 10 <br />CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C) as a condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of safety function to control the <br />release of radioactive material. <br />Event Analysis <br />Timeline of Events on 6/7/2016 <br />1030 Personnel entered the northeast Reactor Building Elevation 272' airlock simultaneously, and the <br />condition was corrected within approximately two (2) seconds. <br />1110 Condition Report (CR-JAF-2016-01996) initiated. <br />1307 NRC notified via ENS 51985 <br />NRC FORM 366A ( 11-2015) <br />Page 3 of 3 <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />.11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

LER NUMBER <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />— 003 <br />YEAR <br />2016 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />— 00 <br />Cause <br />Secondary Containment access openings are equipped with green indicating lights that are lit when the <br />opposing access opening door is fully shut. None of the parties involved indicated they observed the green <br />indicating light not being lit prior to opening the airlock door. Therefore, the cause of this condition was <br />determined to be simultaneous opening of the doors. <br />Similar Events <br />Internal Events <br />LER 2015-004-00, Concurrent Opening of Reactor Building Airlock Doors; Condition Report: <br />CR-JAF-2015-04146, September 17, 2015 <br />External events: <br />Quad Cities Nuclear Generating Station: LER 2015-008, Interlock Doors Opened Simultaneously Cause Loss <br />of Secondary Containment <br />Duane Arnold Energy Center: LER 2015-003-01, Both Doors in Secondary Containment Airlock Opened <br />Concurrently <br />Corrective Actions <br />Completed Actions <br />• Both airlock doors (24R-272-5 & -6) on the northeast Reactor Building Elevation 272' Secondary <br />Containment airlock were closed within approximately two (2) seconds. <br />• Condition Report initiated (CR-JAF-2016-01996); NRC notified via ENS 51985. <br />• Installed cameras and monitors on both sides of the northeast Reactor Building Elevation 272' <br />Secondary Containment airlock. This will allow verification that the opposing door will not be <br />simultaneously opened. <br />Safety Consequence and Implications <br />Actual Consequences <br />There were no actual consequences of this event relative to nuclear, industrial, or radiological safety. <br />Potential Consequences  <br />The Secondary Containment differential pressure remained more negative than 0.25 inches of water vacuum <br />while this condition existed. Therefore, there are no potential consequences of this event relative to nuclear, <br />industrial, or radiological safety. <br />References <br />• Condition Report: CR-JAF-2016-01996, June 7, 2016, Concurrent Opening of Secondary Containment <br />Access Airlocks <br />• Technical Specification 3.6.4.1 <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015)<br /></span>
