LER NUMBER <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />- 004 <br />YEAR <br />2016 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />-00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />PLANT STATUS <br />Cooper Nuclear Station was in Mode 3, Hot Shutdown, at approximately 330 psig, at the time the <br />condition was identified. <br />BACKGROUND <br />The Main Steam system conducts steam from the reactor vessel, via four steam lines, through the <br />Primary Containment to the Main Steam Turbine. Each steam line has two, normally open, Main Steam <br />Isolation Valves (MSIVs) [EIIS:ISV], one inside and one outside the Primary Containment. The MSIVs <br />close automatically upon receipt of certain isolation signals to prevent damage to the fuel cladding by <br />limiting the loss of reactor water during a steam line break outside Primary Containment and also to limit <br />the release of radioactive materials in case of a major leak from Primary Containment. <br />Main Steam Line (MSL) Flow-High is provided to detect a break of the MSL and to initiate closure of the <br />MSIVs. If the steam were allowed to continue flowing out of the break, the reactor would depressurize and <br />the core could uncover. If the Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) water level decreases too far, fuel damage <br />could occur. Therefore, the isolation is initiated on high flow to prevent or minimize core damage. The <br />MSL high flow trip setting was selected high enough to permit the isolation of one MSL for test at rated <br />power without causing an automatic isolation of the rest of the steam lines yet low enough to permit early <br />detection of a steam line break. <br />The MSL flow signals are initiated from 16 differential pressure switches [EIIS:PDIS] that are connected to <br />the four MSLs. The differential pressure switches are arranged such that, even though physically <br />separated from each other, all four connected to one MSL would be able to detect the high flow. <br />EVENT DESCRIPTION <br />On September 24, 2016, at 20:40 hours, during reactor cooldown for Refueling Outage 29, Operations <br />closed the inboard MSIVs to minimize steam flow to control the reactor cooldown rate in accordance with <br />the Normal Shutdown procedure. Reactor pressure was controlled using the main steam line drains. <br />The condensate/feed system was available for reactor water level control. <br />On September 25, 2016, at 01:03 hours, when Operations utilized the Main Steam procedure to equalize <br />pressure across the MSIVs to below 200 psid, a differential pressure (DP) of approximately 190 psid was <br />established. When MS-AO-80A was opened, a Group 1 Isolation was immediately received. All open <br />MSIVs, as well as the MSL Drain Isolation Valves MS-MO-74 and MS-MO-77, closed. The Group 1 <br />isolation was caused by a MSL high flow signal on MSL 'A' as the valve was opening. This was a valid <br />signal based on a review of the steam flow indication for MSL 'A'. <br />Upon investigation it was discovered that the Differential Pressure Indicating Switches (DPIS) for the <br />MSL 'A' high flow signal have a setpoint of 105.8 psid, with a calibration tolerance of +/- 3 psid. The <br />DPIS' measure DP created by flow through the flow element upstream of the MSIV. Therefore, with <br />static DP across the closed MSIVs, at approximately 190 psid prior to opening MS-AO-80A, it was <br />possible that the DPIS' would exceed their setpoint as the MSIV opened and the DP was transferred to <br />Page 2 of 4 <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016) <br />Page 3 of 4 <br />NRC FORM 366 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />(See Page 2 for required number of digits/characters for each block) <br />(See NUREG-1022, R 3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.govireading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr10221r3/) <br /> <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 <br />	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours. <br />Reported lessons learned are incorporated into the licensing process and fed back to industry.

To ensure another Group 1 isolation would not occur, the MSIV DP would <br />have to be below the lowest possible setpoint of the DPIS' (approximately 100 psid). <br />In order to provide margin below the setpoint for the Group 1 isolation, Operations determined that the <br />DP across the MSIVs would be reduced to 75 psid prior to opening the MSIVs. <br />To increase the reactor cooldown rate and lower RPV pressure, Operations began to blow down using <br />Reactor Water Cleanup to Radwaste. Reactor cooldown was also increased by starting Reactor Core <br />Isolation Cooling in pressure control mode. <br />Operations isolated the steam supply to gland steam, High Pressure (HP) turbine cylinder heating, and <br />the Reactor Feed Pump Turbine HP stop valve above the seat drains, bringing the main steam <br />equalizing header pressure up to approximately 118 psig, and the DP across the MSIVs down'to <br />approximately 65 psid. At 18:52 hours, MS-AO-80A was successfully opened and the remaining MSIVs <br />were subsequently opened. <br />BASIS FOR REPORT <br />This condition is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as any event or condition that <br />resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B) of this <br />section, except when 	 (1) the actuation resulted from and was part of a pre-planned sequence during <br />testing or reactor operation; or (2) the actuation was invalid and the system properly removed-from <br />service or with the safety function already completed. <br />SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE <br />The occurrence of the Group 1 isolation signal did not compromise safety systems required to mitigate <br />the consequences of an accident or transient. At the time of the event, the reactor vessel was at <br />approximately 330 psig with all control rods previously inserted as part of the shutdown process. All high <br />pressure and low pressure emergency core cooling systems were operable. The isolation signal was a <br />main steam line high flow, however, no steam leak or break was observed. The plant response to the <br />isolation was as expected. The safety significance of the event is low and did not pose a threat to the <br />health and safety of the public. <br />CAUSE <br />The apparent cause was insufficient procedure guidance exists regarding limitations on opening the <br />MSIVs. <br />CORRECTIVE ACTIONS <br />The applicable procedure has been revised to change the DP limitation for opening an MSIV from 200 <br />psid to 80 psid. <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016) <br />Page 4 of 4 <br />NRC FORM 366 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />o_ 	 LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />(See Page 2 for required number of digits/characters for each block) <br />(See NUREG-1022, R 3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.govireading-rm/doc-collectionsinuregs/staff/sr1022/131)  <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours. <br />Reported lessons learned are incorporated into the licensing process and fed back to industry.
