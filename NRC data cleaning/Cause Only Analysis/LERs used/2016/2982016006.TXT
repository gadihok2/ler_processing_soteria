A <br />vibration analysis was performed and results indicated that vibration readings were elevated across all points for the <br />motor and fan. Consequently, Operations declared CREFS inoperable at 19:08 hours. At 19:53 hours, SF-C-1B was <br />started, CREFS was transferred to the alternate supply, and SF-C-1A was secured. At 23:41, Event Notification <br />52315 was made to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Operations Center. <br />The fan was repaired on October 24 and 25, 2016, and a vibration analysis was performed on October 26, 2016, with <br />satisfactory results. Operations declared CREFS operable at 1341 on October 27, 2016. <br />The root cause was the preventive maintenance strategy for the fan was ineffective to ensure shaft to bearing <br />engagement is maintained. To prevent recurrence, the applicable maintenance plan will be revised to include <br />verification that the bearings are adequately engaged to the fan shaft. <br />This is a Safety System Functional Failure. <br />3.

Diesel <br />Generator (DG) 2 was inoperable for maintenance. <br />BACKGROUND <br />The Control Room Emergency Filter System (CREFS) [EIIS:JH] is designed to provide a radiologically <br />controlled environment to ensure the habitability of the control room for the safety of control room <br />operators under all plant conditions. The CREFS is a standby system. The instrumentation and controls <br />for the CREFS automatically isolate the normal ventilation intake and initiate action to pressurize the <br />main control room and filter incoming air to minimize the infiltration of radioactive material into the control <br />room environment. <br />The safety related function of CREFS includes a single high efficiency air filtration system for emergency <br />treatment of outside supply air and a Control Room Envelope boundary that limits the inleakage of <br />unfiltered air. The system consists of a prefilter, a high efficiency air particulate air filter [El IS:FLT], an <br />activated charcoal adsorber [EllS:ADS] section, a supply fan [EllS:FAN], and emergency booster fan, an <br />exhaust booster fan, and the associated ductwork [EIIS:DUCT], valves [EllS:V] or dampers [EIIS:DMP], <br />doors [EllS:DR], barriers, and instrumentation. <br />Technical Specifications (TS) 3.7.4 requires one supply fan to be Operable to support CREFS <br />Operability. <br />In MODES 4 and 5, maintaining CREFS operable is not required except during Operations with a <br />Potential for Draining the Reactor Vessel (OPDRV); and during movement of lately irradiated fuel <br />assemblies in the secondary containment. Due to radioactive decay, CREFS is only required to be <br />OPERABLE during fuel handing involving handling of lately irradiated fuel. <br />Power supply for Supply. Fan SF-C-1A is MCC LX (Division 1). Power supply for SF-C-1B is MCC-TX <br />(Division 2). <br />EVENT DESCRIPTION <br />On October 21, 2016, Operations declared Diesel Generator 2 Inoperable in preparation for performing <br />planned maintenance: Therefore, only SF-C-1A had essential power available. <br />On October 23, 2016, at 11:54 hours, Operations entered an OPDRV condition for Control Rod Drive <br />maintenance using a freeze seal. The OPDRV condition required CREFS to be operable. <br />On October 23, 2016, at 13:56 hours, it was observed that control room supply fans were shaking while <br />SF-C-1A was running, and it was noticed that a belt guard bracket had broken off. <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016) <br />1.

It was recommended that SF-C-1A be removed from service. Operations <br />declared CREFS inoperable at 19:08 hours, entering TS Limiting Condition for Operation 3.7.4, Condition <br />A. At 19:53 hours, SF-C-1B was started and SF-C-1A was secured. <br />The fan was repaired on October 24 and 25, 2016. A vibration analysis was performed on October 26, <br />2016, with satisfactory results and Operations declared CREFS operable at 13:41 on October 27, 2016. <br />During investigation it was found that the drive end bearing locking collar was loose from the bearing and <br />the shaft. This allowed the shaft to turn within the bearing inner race, causing damage to the shaft and <br />resulting in high vibration levels. Preventive Maintenance (PM) on the Control Room supply fans are <br />lubricated every 26 weeks, but the PM does not verify that bearing setscrews or locking collars are tight. <br />BASIS FOR REPORT <br />This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) as a condition that could have <br />prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to mitigate the <br />consequences of an accident. Event Notification 52315 was made to the Nuclear Regulatory <br />Commission Operations Center. <br />SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE <br />This is a Safety System Functional Failure because of the loss of a single train safety-related system. <br />The plant was in MODE 5 performing refueling activities and conducting an OPDRV activity. CREFS <br />was required to be operable in case of a drain down event resulting in uncovering fuel. The CREF <br />system was fully functional with the exception of the SF-C-1A fan and the DG2 emergency electrical <br />power supply to SF-C-1B. In the case of a drain down event, SF-C-1B was capable of being manually <br />started and still had electrical power available from the Normal Station Service Transformer back feed <br />and the Emergency Station Service Transformer. There were no actual safety consequences associated <br />with this event. The potential safety consequences of this event were minimal due to the limited duration <br />the condition existed and the redundant safety equipment which remained operable. <br />CAUSE <br />The root cause is the preventive maintenance strategy for the fan was ineffective to ensure shaft to <br />bearing engagement is maintained. <br />Page 3 of 4 <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016) <br />NRC FORM 366 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />(See Page 2 for required number of digits/characters for each block) <br />(See NUREG-1022, R 3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.govireading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1022/r31) <br /> <br />Page 4 of 4 <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 <br />	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours. <br />Reported lessons learned are incorporated into the licensing process and fed back to industry.
