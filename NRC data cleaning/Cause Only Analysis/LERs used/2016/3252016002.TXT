At this time, EDG 1, Emergency bus El, and balance of plant (BOP) bus 1D were inoperable due to <br />planned maintenance. Two inoperable EDGs represents a loss of safety function, for the onsite standby power source. <br />Therefore, this condition is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D), as an event or condition that <br />could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of a system that is needed to mitigate the consequences of <br />an accident. In addition, it was determined that EDG 3 was inoperable for greater than Technical Specifications (TSs) <br />Completion Times. Therefore, this condition is also being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as <br />operation prohibited by the TSs. Additionally, on March 3, work was ongoing to restore power to BOP bus 1D when an <br />error in the restoration sequence resulted in an invalid auto-start of EDGs 2 and 4. Because the invalid auto-starts of <br />EDGs 2 and 4 are directly related to the events associated with this LER, it is being reported, herein, per 10 CFR • <br />50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) rather than the optional 60-day telephone notification. <br />The root cause of the EDG 3 inoperability is a design vulnerability associated with relaxation of the EDG 3 fuse holder <br />fingers which was not properly mitigated. The corrective action to prevent recurrence will be to implement a design <br />change to address the vulnerability. <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016) <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(06-2016)) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.qov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nureqs/staff/sr1022/r3/)  <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

Emergency Diesel Generator 1 (EDG 1) [EK] was inoperable in support of modifications, <br />maintenance activities, and testing. Emergency bus El [EB] and balance of plant (BOP) bus 1D were <br />deenergized in support of this work. No other Unit 2 safety-related equipment was inoperable. <br />Reportability Criteria <br />10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) <br />Brunswick EDG capacity is such that any three of the four diesels can supply the required loads for the <br />safe shutdown of one unit and a design basis accident on the other unit without offsite power. As such, <br />simultaneous inoperability of EDGs 1 and 3 is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D), as <br />an event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function needed to mitigate the <br />consequences of an accident. The NRC was initially notified of the event on March 4, 2016 (i.e., Event <br />Number 51769). <br />As discussed below, it has been determined that EDG 3 was inoperable from February 7, 2016, until <br />March 4, 2016. During this time, EDGs 1, 2, and 4 were also inoperable, at various times, for surveillance <br />testing and associated activities. These occurrences are also reportable in accordance with <br />10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D), as an event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety <br />function needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. <br />Event Number 51769 also reported loss of safety function of the Conventional Service Water system [BI], <br />the Control Room EmerOency Ventilation system [VI], and the Control Room Air Condition system [VI]. <br />After additional review, it has been determined that a loss of safety fundtion of these systems did not <br />occur. As such, this event is not reportable per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v) or 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v) for those <br />systems. <br />10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) <br />This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as operation prohibited by the plant's <br />Technical Specifications (TSs) for both Unit 1 and Unit 2. The following conditions resulted in <br />unintentional operation prohibited by the plant's TSs given the inoperability of EDG 3. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 2 of 7 <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(06-2016)) <br />.000 RFON,,0  <br />1 LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />..... <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.n rc.qov/readinchrm/doc-collections/nu reos/staff/sr1022/r3/) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

LER NUMBER <br />Brunswick Steam Electric Plant (BSEP), <br />Unit 1 <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />002 <br />05000-325 <br />YEAR <br />2016 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />- 01 <br />NARRATIVE <br />• On February 8, 2016, at 2211 Eastern Standard Time (EST), Unit 2 would have been required to <br />be in Mode 3 in accordance with TS 3.8.1, Required Action H.1, for one offsite circuit inoperable <br />and one EDG inoperable (i.e., TS 3.8.1, Condition F). <br />• On February 12, 2016, at 2357 EST, Unit 1 entered Mode 2 from Mode 4. This constituted a <br />violation of Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.0.4. <br />• On February 20, 2016, at 1157 EST, Unit 1 would have been required to be in Mode 3 in <br />accordance with TS 3.8.1, Required Action H.1, for a single EDG inoperable (i.e., TS 3.8.1, <br />Condition D). <br />• On February 21, 2016, at 0806 EST, Unit 1 and Unit 2 would have been required to be in Mode 3 <br />in accordance with TS 3.8.1, Required Action H.1, for two EDGs inoperable (i.e., TS 3.8.1, <br />Condition G). <br />• On March 3, 2016, at 2108 EST, Unit 2 would have been required to be in Mode 2 in accordance <br />with LCO 3.0.3, per TS 3.8.1, Condition I, (i.e., one or more offsite circuits and two or more Diesel <br />Generators (DGs) inoperable). <br />10, CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) <br />On March 3, work was ongoing to restore power to BOP bus 1D when an error in the restoration sequence <br />resulted in an invalid auto-start of EDGs 2 and 4 at 1332 EST. EDGs 2 and 4 responded properly to the <br />auto-start signal and ran unloaded. Since no actual bus under voltage condition existed which required <br />the EDGs to start, and the start was not in response to actual plant conditions satisfying the requirements <br />for initiation, this event has been classified as an invalid actuation. Because the invalid auto-starts of <br />EDGs 2 and 4 are directly related to the events associated with this LER, the event is being reported via <br />this LER rather than the optional 60-day telephone notification as allowed by 10 CFR 50.73(a)(1). <br />Event Description <br />On March 2, at 1458 EST, EDG 1 was declared inoperable in support of modifications, maintenance <br />activities, and testing. Emergency bus El and balance of plant (BOP) bus 1D were deenergized in <br />support of this work. This was a planned maintenance activity, being performed during the ongoing Unit 1 <br />refueling outage. Due to the shared electrical distribution system at Brunswick, Unit 2 was in TS 3.8.1, <br />Condition B (i.e., two Unit 1 offsite circuits inoperable due to one Unit 1 balance of plant circuit path to the <br />downstrethm 4.16 kV emergency bus inoperable for planned maintenance and the EDG associated with <br />the affected downstream 4.16 kV emergency bus inoperable for planned maintenance). <br />On March 3, work was ongoing to restore power to BOP bus 1D when an error in the restoration sequence <br />resulted in an invalid auto-start of EDGs 2 and 4. The invalid signal mimicked undervoltage on the startup <br />auxiliary transformer (SAT) [EA], which is not a TS required start and, per design, would have started <br />EDGs 1, 2, 3, and 4. EDG .1 was under clearance and, as such, did not start. However, it was also <br />expected that EDG 3 should have started. Troubleshooting activities and a thorough EDG 1 modification <br />review were initiated. As a result, on March 4, 2016, at 1235 hours EST, it was determined that continuity <br />was lost across a dummy fuse block in the auto-start circuitry for EDG 3. This failure prevented TS <br />required auto-actuation of EDG 3. Therefore, EDG 3 was declared inoperable.

Required Action 1.1 directs immediate entry into LCO 3.0.3. <br />Duke Energy Progress, Inc., verbally requested a Notice of Enforcement Discretion (NOED) to extend the <br />time required by LCO 3.0.3 for Unit 2 to be in Mode 2, Mode 3, and Mode 4 by 17 hours. The NRC <br />verbally approved the NOED at 1535 EST on March 4, 2016. EDG 3 was restored to operable status and <br />LCO 3.0.3 was exited at 1834 EST after replacement of the fuse holder. This was before the original <br />Completion Time of LCO 3.0.3 (i.e., be in Mode 2 by March 4, 2016, at 1935 EST). <br />As a result of the root cause evaluation of this event, the direct cause of the EDG 3 failure to auto-start <br />was identified as a loss of continuity in the 2-DG3-FU-1-ECR Dummy Fuse at EDG 3 Emergency Control <br />Relay (ECR) Disconnect; specifically, loose fuse clamps in the dummy fuse block/holder. Further, there is <br />firm evidence that this condition existed since February 7, 2016, when EDG 3 successfully auto-started in <br />response to a Unit 1 SAT lock-out condition, the details of which are discussed in Brunswick <br />LER 1-2016-001, dated April 6, 2016. On February 7, operators observed that the auto-start indications <br />for EDG 3 (i.e., annunciator UA-21 5-2, and lights) had cleared, without operator action. This provides <br />indication that the loss of continuity in the dummy fuse holder occurred at that time. The unexpected <br />clearing indicates a loss of power to the ECR relay, the same failure mechanism that prevented EDG 3 <br />auto-start on March 3. Therefore, it is concluded that the equipment issue was present from February 7 <br />until March 4, when the fuse holder was replaced. Inoperability of EDG 3 was determined to be from <br />2211 EST on February 7, when the EDG 3 was secured from the auto-start, until 1834 EST on March 4, <br />2016, following replacement of the faulty fuse holder. <br />A review was performed to determine instances when EDGs 1, 2, or 4 were inoperable during the period <br />from February 7, 2016, until March 4, 2016. The following instances were identified. Note, the times <br />provided are approximate, based on Operations Log entries. <br />EDG 1 <br />February 20 at 1806 EST to March 2 at 1226 EST (i.e., 10 days, 18 hours, 20 minutes) for planned <br />replacement of the automatic voltage regulator and margin improvement modifications. <br />March 2 at 1458 EST to March 9 at 0,151 EST (i.e., 6 days, 10 hours, 53 minutes) for Division 1 <br />electrical outage and DG 1 governor modification.

Unit 1 was in Mode 1 until February 26 at 2129 when <br />Mode 3 was entered to start the refueling outage. <br />Event Cause  <br />The root cause of this event is a design vulnerability associated with relaxation of the EDG 3 fuse holder <br />fingers which was not properly mitigated. The existing design lacks circuit continuity indication that is not <br />mitigated by design or testing. <br />The direct cause for the EDG 3 failure to start was determined to be a loss of continuity through a dummy <br />fuse in the auto-start logic circuit for EDG 3, which prevented the ECR coil from being energized and thus <br />starting the diesel. The loss of continuity through the ECR fuse block assembly was a result of loose fuse <br />holder fingers. ECR fuse block assembly was installed as a result of a 2011/2012 modification performed <br />on the auto-start circuitry of each EDG. This modification installed an intermediate clearance point <br />between the Lock Out Control Relay (LOCR) and ECR. During the 2011 engineering change process <br />where the fuse block design was identified, the risk was identified that fuse block/clip-to-fuse electrical <br />contact may open/fail. The risk was identified but positive measures were not put into place to mitigate <br />the risk beyond visual verification that the brass dummy fuse was installed. <br />Safety Assessment <br />The safety significance of this event is minimal. <br />On March 3, 2016, BOP Bus,1D, E1, E5, and EDG 1 were inoperable due to,ongoing maintenance (i.e., <br />Unit 1 Division 1 AC outage window). The planned Unit 1 maintenance activity had been properly risk <br />assessed prior to the beginning of the outage. The unplanned inoperability of EDG 3 had minimal impact <br />on Unit 1. EDG 3/E3 are primarily associated with Unit 2 loads. A loss of power to E3 could have <br />impacted the lA Residual Heat Removal (RHR) pump [BO] and the 1A RHR Service Water (SW) pump <br />[BO]. However, on March 3, Unit 1 was flooded up with the spent fuel pool gates removed. Time to boil <br />was approximately 19 hours. Per TS 3.9.7, one RHR shutdown cooling subsystem is required to be <br />operable and in operation in Mode 5 with irradiated fuel in the Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) and the <br />water level greater than or equal to 21 feet 10 inches above the RPV flange. The primary means of <br />shutdown cooling was B RHR with D RHR the backup. Additionally, EDG 3 could be manually started. <br />Based on these considerations, the event is of minimal safety significance for Unit 1. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 5 of 7 <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(06-2016)) <br />"° '4,0 <br />• .7, LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.govireadine-rm/doc-collections/nureqs/staff/sr1022/r3f)  <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

EDG 2, EDG 4, and offsite power sources (i.e., excluding <br />offsite power to emergency bus El) were not affected by the EDG 1 maintenance and were operable. <br />Emergency buses E2, E3, and E4 continued to be powered from offsite power. As such, sufficient offsite <br />power supplies remained available to complete their intended safety function. The Supplemental Diesel <br />Generator (SUPP-DG), installed to support a 14-day completion time for an inoperable EDG, remained <br />available, as well as the two permanently installed FLEX diesels. The SUPP-DG is rated at 4000 kW, <br />4160 VAC, and can provide power to the emergency busses in approximately 1 hour. Each FLEX diesel <br />is rated at 500 kW, 480 VAC, and can be connected to the emergency busses in less than one hour. <br />Except for the periods of time for repair activities and post-repair testing, EDG 3 was available via manual <br />start. <br />A Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) was performed to determine the impact of EDG 3 being inoperable <br />from February 7 until March 4, 2016. This analysis concluded that this was of very low safety significance. <br />Corrective Actions  <br />Any changes to the corrective actions and schedules noted below will be made in accordance with the <br />site's corrective action program. <br />The following corrective action to prevent recurrence is planned. <br />• A design change, for each EDG ECR fuse block, to ensure continuity is maintained or a loss of <br />circuit continuity is detected will be installed. Installation is currently scheduled to be completed by <br />December 31, 2017. <br />In addition, the following corrective actions have been completed or are planned. <br />• EDG 3 was restored to operable status on March 4, 2016, after replacement of the degraded <br />dummy fuse holder. The dummy fuse holders for EDGs 1, 2, and 4 will be replaced. This is <br />currently scheduled to be completed by October 10, 2016. <br />Previous Similar Events  <br />A review of LERs for the past five years identified the following previous similar occurrence. <br />• LER 1-2015-002, Revision 1, dated November 11, 2015, reported loss of safety function due to <br />inoperability of EDGs 3 and 4. The root cause of the event was a procedural inadequacy in the <br />commercial grade dedication process that allowed an unauthorized component modification to go <br />unrecognized. To prevent recurrence of a similar event, procedure AD-EG-ALL-1103, <br />"Procurement Engineering Products," was revised. Since the causes of the events were different, <br />the actions from LER 1-2015-002 could not have reasonably been expected to prevent the <br />condition reported in LER 1-2016-002. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 6 of 7 <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(06-2016)) <br />If, <br />• .f <br />A LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />% (ar,12 	 CONTINUATION SHEET <br />...a. <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.00v/readinci-rm/doc-collections/nureos/staff/sr1022/r3/) <br /> <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.
