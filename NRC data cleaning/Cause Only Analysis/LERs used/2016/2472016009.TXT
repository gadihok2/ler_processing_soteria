Prior to starting the <br />test, the I&C technicians were unable to locate key #184 that was identified in the <br />test as associated with the reactor trip breaker B bypass key switch. 	 Control Room <br />staff recommended obtaining key #183 associated with reactor trip breaker A bypass key <br />switch to use in lieu of key #184. 	 To ensure the key would work prior to starting the <br />test, the train B bypass key switch was positioned by an I&C technician to the Defeat <br />position. 	 Because reactor trip Bypass Breaker B was in the racked out position, when <br />the key switch was taken to the Defeat position, it caused the normal Reactor Trip <br />Breaker B to open, which initiated a reactor trip (RT) and auxiliary feedwater system <br />actuation. 	 The direct cause was an I&C technician turned the key interlock to defeat <br />on switchgear Channel B Reactor Protection Logic without having the BYB Bypass breaker <br />racked in and closed. 	 The root cause was Indian Point personnel emphasized work <br />culture production goals without fully recognizing the need to maintain fundamental <br />standards and expectations for nuclear workers. 	 Key corrective actions included site <br />all-hands meeting discussing the event, lessons learned, reinforced expectations and <br />the Fleet Refocus Initiative.

The purpose of <br />the surveillance is to perform actuation logic testing of the Reactor Protection <br />System {JC} logic Train B in accordance with Technical Specification (TS) 3.3.1 <br />(Reactor Protection System Instrumentation) Table 3.3.1-1, Function 20, Surveillance <br />Requirement 3.3.1.5. The test had been originally scheduled for June 30, 2016, but <br />due to concerns about Battery Changer 22 grounds, the test was re-scheduled for the <br />following week., <br />At approximately 07:30 hours, on July 6, 2016, a pre-job briefing was held with four <br />I&C technicians and the I&C job Supervisor. Subsequent to the briefing, the I&C <br />technicians went to the Control Room {NA} and informed the Control Room Supervisor <br />(CRS) of the test and what to expect. In the prerequisites section of 2-PT-2M3A, the <br />breaker interlock key number 182, 184 or equivalent was to be obtained from <br />operations prior to commencing the test. At approximately 9:15 hours, I&C personnel <br />determined neither key number 182 nor key number 184 could be found in the Control <br />Room key locker. The CRS suggested that the Train A key number 183 could be used as <br />an equivalent because it was believed that both trains were keyed the same. <br />Due to concerns with the short Technical Specification (TS) 8-hour Allowed Outage <br />Time (AOT) for the test the I&C technicians wanted to ensure the key would work prior <br />to entering the TS Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) and starting the test and <br />discussed it with the CRS. The key concerns were discussed with the CRS. After a <br />brief discussion, the I&C technicians believed that Operations gave them permission <br />to test the key prior to starting the surveillance test. Operations believed that <br />the I&C technicians would test the key during the surveillance. <br />At approximately 9:30 hours, two of the I&C technicians, one operator and two Nuclear <br />Plant Operator (NPOs) took key number 183 (designated for Train A) to the location of <br />the Reactor Trip Breakers (RTBs) {BKR}(Cable Spreading Room) {NA}. The 8-hour TS LCO <br />was not entered. Two non-licensed operators (NPOs) were present in the Cable <br />Spreading Room to rack in the bypass breaker when requested by the I&C technicians. <br />The Field Shift Supervisor (FSS) was also there to inspect cables that were utilized <br />with the Rod Drop Testing during the recent outage. One of the I&C technicians <br />called the Control Room and told another I&C technician, who was staged in the <br />Control Room, that they would receive an annunciator on Panel SK, Window 2-5. The <br />Control Room operator acknowledged the alert of an expected alarm and the I&C <br />technician in the Control Room relayed the acknowledgement to the I&C technician in <br />the Cable Spreading Room containing the RTBs. <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />Page 2 of 6 <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />1.

Without using a procedure or an approved work instruction, the other I&C <br />technician positioned the Train B bypass key switch to defeat.. Because reactor <br />trip Bypass Breaker B was in the racked out position, when the train B bypass key <br />switch was taken to the Defeat position, it caused the normal Reactor Trip Breaker <br />B to open, which initiated a reactor trip (RT) at approximately 9:38 hours. <br />All control rods {AA} fully inserted and all required safety systems functioned <br />properly. The plant was stabilized in hot standby with decay heat being removed by <br />the condenser (SG). The auxiliary feedwater system {BA} actuated as expected due to <br />steam generator low level from shrink effect. <br />Normally during performance of the test, the train B bypass key switch is only <br />positioned to Defeat after Bypass Breaker B has been closed and the Reactor Trip <br />Breaker B- has been opened. The condition was recorded in the Indian Point Energy <br />Center (IPEC) Corrective Action Program (CAP) in. Condition Report CR-IP2-2016-04320. <br />The reactor protection system (RPS) {JC} initiates a reactor shutdown, based on <br />values of selected unit parameters, to protect against violating the core fuel design <br />limits and reactor coolant system pressure boundary during anticipated operational <br />occurrences and to assist the Engineered Safety Feature Systems in mitigating <br />accidents. The RPS instrumentation is segmented into four distinct but <br />interconnected modules one of which is reactor trip switchgear that includes the <br />reactor trip breakers (RTBs) and Bypass Breakers. These components provide a means <br />to interrupt power to the control rod drive mechanisms (CRDMs) and allows the rod <br />cluster control assemblies (RCCAs) or rods to fall into the core and shut down the <br />reactor. The bypass breakers allow testing of the RTBs at power. The control rod <br />drive system is designed such that the control rods are held in place and are capable <br />of being moved only when its power supply is energized. Two RTBs placed in series <br />with the control rod drive power supply remain closed as long as their respective <br />under-voltage coils are kept energized by the RPS logic buses. Two bypass breakers <br />are provided to allow in service testing of either RTB. The key-interlock switch is <br />provided such that if both bypass breakers are closed at the same time while racked <br />in, both bypass breakers will be tripped. This interlock is defeated in the test <br />position with the key to allow for tripping of the undervoltage device of the bypass <br />breaker when the reactor is in operation. The key interlock switch at the Reactor <br />Trip Switchgear is placed in the Defeat position to prevent repeated breaker <br />operation as the logics are tripped and reset. <br />During normal testing of the RPS Logic, the bypass breaker is racked in and closed and <br />the key-interlock switch would then only bring in the alarm in the Control Room <br />supervisory annunciator. For this event the bypass breaker was not racked in <br />(closed). <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />Page 3 of 6 <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />1.

During normal testing of <br />Channel B, the associated key-interlock switch would have been placed in the defeat <br />position. This would have resulted in: 1) Illuminating a red light on the Train B <br />cabinet, 2) Annunciating an alarm RTB & BYA Train B Defeat on the Control Room <br />supervisory annunciator, 3) Opened up the closing circuit of RTB which is being <br />tested, 4) Opened up the coil circuit of undervoltage trip devices for breakers RTB <br />and BYA which is being tested and preventing the unit from tripping. In this event <br />the key bypass switch was turned to the defeat position while the Bypass Breaker was <br />still racked out (open) which de-energized the undervoltage coil for the B RTB which <br />caused it to open and trip the unit. <br />An extent of condition (EOC) review determined the condition is bounded to only the <br />RTBs because they are the only breakers with a key-interlocked switch such that if <br />both bypass breakers are closed at the same time while racked in, both bypass <br />breakers will be tripped. The test procedure for unit 2 calls for key number 182, <br />184 or allows for an equivalent key to be used. This is vague guidance unlike unit <br />3 which only has one key. The Unit 2 test procedure 2-PT-2M3A will be revised to <br />remove "equivalent." <br />CAUSE OF EVENT <br />The direct cause of the RT was due to operating the "B" RPS bypass key out of <br />sequence during Reactor Protection logic testing. An I&C technician turned the key <br />interlock to defeat on switchgear Channel B Reactor Protection Logic without having <br />the BYB Bypass Breaker racked in and closed, which opened the undervoltage tripping <br />device of the RTB and tripped the reactor. The I&C technician turned the key without <br />procedural guidance. The I&C technicians were testing the key with verbal guidance <br />from operations, due to vague procedure guidance in 2-PT-2M3A, that allowed an <br />equivalent key to be used (number 183). Due to not stopping when unsure <br />(conservative decision making), the I&C technicians tested the key prior to starting <br />the surveillance because of perceived time pressure. <br />The root cause (RC) of the event was that IPEC personnel emphasized work culture <br />production goals for productivity, schedule adherence, and backlog reduction without <br />fully recognizing the need to maintain fundamental standards and expectations for <br />nuclear workers, such as procedure use and adherence and staying in process during <br />work activities. The RC resulted in the I&C technician turning the key without <br />procedure guidance or work instructions and tripped the plant. <br />CORRECTIVE ACTIONS <br />The following corrective actions have been or <br />Action Program (CAP) to address the causes of <br />• Site all-hands meeting was held to discuss <br />to reinforce expectations. <br />will be performed under the Corrective <br />this event: <br />the event, the lessons learned, and <br />Page 4 of 6 <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />••••• <br />	 LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />1.

Systems to which the requirements of <br />10CFR50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) apply for this event include the Reactor Protection System <br />including reactor trip and AFWS actuation. This event meets the reporting criteria <br />because an automatic reactor trip was initiated at 9:38 hours, on July 6, 2016, and <br />the AFWS actuated as a result of the RT. On July 6, 2016, at 13:16 hours, a four <br />hour non-emergency notification was made to the NRC (Log Number 52067) for an <br />automatic reactor trip while critical and included the eight hour non-emergency <br />notification for the actuation of the AFW system. Both notifications were in <br />accordance with 10CFR50.72(b)(3)(iv)(1). The event was recorded in the Indian Point <br />Energy Center corrective action program (CAP) as CR-IP2-2016-04320. <br />As all primary safety systems functioned properly there was no safety system <br />functional failure reportable under 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(v). <br />PAST SIMILAR EVENTS <br />A review was performed of the past three years of Licensee Event Reports (LERs) for <br />events that involved a reactor trip due to testing of the reactor protection system. <br />No applicable LERs were identified. <br />SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE <br />This event had no effect on the health and safety of the public. <br />This condition had no effect on the health and safety of the public. <br />There were no actual safety consequences for the event because the event was an <br />uncomplicated reactor trip with no other transients or accidents. <br />• Small Group Meetings. <br />• from the Fleet Refocus Initiative. <br />Site All-hands meeting was held to <br />Conducted Fleet Refocus Initiative <br />Implemented observation activities <br />As an interim action all essential <br />Page 5 of 6 <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />Page 6 of 6 <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />	 US.NUCLEARREGULATORYCOMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO.3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER a LER NUMBER <br />2016 	 - 009 	 - 00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />Required primary safety systems performed as designed when the RT was initiated. The <br />AFWS actuation was an expected reaction as a result of low SG water level due to SG <br />void fraction (shrink), which occurs after a RT and main steam back pressure as a <br />result of the rapid reduction of steam flow due to turbine control valve closure. <br />For this RT there was no actual condition to initiate the reactor trip breaker <br />opening. Event was initiated by human error. <br />There were no significant potential safety consequences of this event. The RPS is <br />designed to actuate .a RT for any anticipated combination of plant conditions to <br />include low SG level. All components in the RCS were designed to withstand the <br />effects of cyclic loads due to reactor system temperature and pressure changes. The <br />reactor trip breakers (RTBs) are in the electrical power supply line from the control <br />rod drive motor generator set power supply to the CRDMs. Opening of the RTBs <br />interrupts power to the CRDMs, which allows the shutdown rods to fall into the core <br />by gravity. Each reactor trip breaker (RTB) is equipped with a reactor trip bypass <br />breaker (RTBB) to allow testing of the trip breaker while the unit is at power. Each <br />RTB and RTBB is equipped with an undervoltage coil and a shunt trip coil to trip the <br />breaker open when needed. The reactor trip signals generated by the RPS automatic <br />trip logic cause the RTBs and associated RTBB to open and shut down the reactor. <br />There are two RTBs in series so that opening either will interrupt power to the rod <br />control system and allow the control rods to fall into the core and shut down the <br />reactor. Each RTB has a parallel RTBB that is normally open. This feature allows <br />testing of the RTBs at power. A trip signal from RPS logic train A will trip RTB A <br />and RTBB B; and a trip signal from logic train B will trip RTB B and RTBB A. During <br />normal operation, both RTBs are closed and both RTBBs are open. When any one train <br />is taken out of service for testing, the other train is capable of providing unit <br />monitoring and protection until the testing has been completed. <br />For this event, rod control was in automatic and all rods inserted upon initiation of <br />a RT. The AFWS actuated and provided required FW flow to-the SGs. RCS pressure <br />remained below the set point for pressurizer PORV or code safety valve operation and <br />above the set point for automatic safety injection actuation. Following the RT, the <br />plant was stabilized in hot standby. <br />Indian Point 2 05000-247 <br />YEAR SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />REV <br />NO. <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015)<br /></span>
