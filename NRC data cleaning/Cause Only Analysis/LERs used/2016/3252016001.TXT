At that time, an electrical fault occurred on a balance of plant <br />4160-volt bus, resulting in a lockout of the Startup Auxiliary Transformer (SAT) and a loss of both Reactor <br />Recirculation pumps. Licensed personnel inserted a manual scram per procedure. Emergency Diesel <br />Generators supplied emergency electrical busses until offsite power was restored at 1628 EST. The loss of <br />power and reactor water level changes resulted in automatic closures of various Primary Containment <br />Isolation Valves (PCIVs). The electrical fault resulted in an electrical explosion; therefore, an Alert was <br />declared at 1326 EDT. The immediate cause of this event was a fault in a non-segregated electrical bus <br />connected to the SAT. The root causes were insufficient detail in applicable maintenance instructions for <br />inspecting the non-segregated bus housing and inadequate instructions for terminating electrical cables in a <br />circuit breaker cubicle. Corrective actions include repairing equipment damaged by the electrical fault and <br />revising the procedures and work instructions. <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />r'0<br />9-"`",kt. <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />.....

No out-of-service equipment <br />contributed to, or affected the course of, this event. <br />Reportability Criteria <br />This event is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) because it involved actuations <br />of systems listed in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(B). Specific actuations included: <br />• The Reactor Protection System (RPS) [JE] was manually actuated due to loss of both Reactor <br />Recirculation [AD] system pumps. <br />• Several Primary Containment Isolation Valves (PCIVs) [JM] automatically closed per design in <br />response to either loss of control logic power or reactor water level changes that resulted from the <br />reactor scram. <br />• Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs) [EK] started and provided power to emergency electrical <br />busses El and E2 [EB] in response to a loss of offsite power (LOOP). <br />• The High Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) [BJ] system was manually started to control reactor <br />pressure following the scram. <br />• The Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) [BN] system was manually started to control reactor <br />water level following the scram. <br />The NRC was notified of the event, including the emergency declaration, per 10 CFR 50.72(a)(1)(i), <br />10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B), and 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) via Event Notification (EN) number 51715 at <br />13:46 EST on February 7, 2016. <br />Event Description <br />On February 7, 2016, at 1312 EST, BSEP Unit 1 was in Mode 1 during end-of-cycle coastdown. Two arc <br />flashes occurred in a 4160-volt electrical system which resulted in two phases of the system faulting to <br />ground, which also constituted a phase-to-phase fault. The high differential current actuated the lockout <br />on the Unit 1 Startup Auxiliary Transformer (SAT) [EA], which started all four emergency diesel <br />generators. The loss of power to equipment fed from the SAT resulted in shutdown of both Reactor <br />Recirculation system pumps. With both pumps not operating, station procedures require licensed <br />personnel to insert a manual scram. This was performed immediately, and all control rods [AA] fully <br />inserted into the core per design. <br />The manual scram automatically shut down the main turbine [TA] and main generator [EL] per design. <br />With the main generator offline, the power circuit breakers for the Unit Auxiliary Transformer (UAT) [EA] <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

This interrupted power to emergency busSes El and E2. <br />Since the SAT was already locked out, the power source for busses El and E2 could not transfer to the <br />SAT. Therefore, a LOOP condition existed on emergency electrical busses El and E2. EDG1 and EDG2 <br />were already running and automatically tied to their respective busses, El and E2. On Unit 2, EDG3 and <br />EDG4 started per design, but did not connect to their busses because the LOOP condition did not exist on <br />Unit 2. <br />Following shutdown of the main turbine, reactor pressure was initially controlled by opening safety/relief <br />valves [SB]. When pressure was stable, licensed personnel manually started the HPCI system and <br />maintained control of reactor pressure, and they started the RCIC system for the purpose of maintaining <br />reactor water level. After the manual scram, reactor water level decreased below Low Level 1 per the <br />normal, expected water level shrinkage that follows a reactor scram. The low water level resulted in <br />additional, redundant RPS actuation signals being received, and Group 2 and Group 6 PCIVs received an <br />auto closure signal. The momentary loss of power that occurred between the LOOP and energizing the <br />busses via the EDGs also resulted in Group 1, Group 3, and Group 10 PCIVs receiving a closure signal. <br />All affected PCIVs closed per design. <br />Standby Gas Treatment System (SBGT) [BH] fans started due to the LOOP condition. However, <br />associated Secondary Containment dampers [VA] did not reposition because the relays in the damper <br />control logic are not designed to seal in, and the duration of the transient when the bus was depowered <br />was too brief for the dampers to physically complete their movement before the EDGs repowered the <br />busses and the signal cleared. <br />Operations personnel promptly performed a walkdown of plant equipment and noted evidence that an arc <br />flash had occurred in a balance of plant 4160-volt circuit breaker cubicle which supplies the 1B Reactor <br />Recirculation Pump Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) unit. The breaker cubicle showed evidence of an <br />electrical explosion; that is, the cubicle door was deformed. Per Emergency Action Level HA2.1, evidence <br />of an explosion in an area affecting safe shutdown equipment requires entry into an Alert. Thus, the Alert <br />was declared at 1326 EST. <br />At 1628 EST on February 7, 2016, offsite power was restored to electrical busses El and E2 by <br />connecting the UAT to the grid and supplying power to the busses from the UAT, which is their normal <br />source. At 1751 EST, the emergency classification was downgraded to an Unusual Event (UE) because <br />the plant no longer met the criteria for an Alert, since the source of the explosion was determined not to <br />have affected safe shutdown equipment. The UE emergency declaration was terminated at 1814 EST. <br />Event Causes <br />The initiating event was two arc flashes that occurred in a non-segregated bus (i.e., a bus in which all <br />three phases lie within a single housing) and in a circuit breaker cubicle which powers the 1B VFD for a <br />Reactor Recirculation system pump. The first arc flash occurred in an area of the bus housing outdoors <br />where water had accumulated. The fault created a voltage imbalance which led to the second arc flash <br />which occurred in the breaker cubicle where cable insulation was found to be degraded. <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

The water created the conditions conducive to an arc flash. <br />In the breaker cubicle for the 16 VFD, it was found that during installation in 2010 of electrical stress-<br />relieving insulation (i.e., "stress cones"), the dielectric insulation on a cable jacket had been damaged <br />when a piece of semiconducting material was being removed. The arc flash occurred at the point where <br />the cable insulation had been damaged. <br />The root cause of the moisture intrusion into the non-segregated bus was inspection procedures did not <br />contain sufficient specific detail based on highest risk locations (i.e., specifically, horizontal surfaces <br />through which bars penetrate) to ensure that deficiencies that can lead to water intrusion are identified and <br />corrected during its implementation. A contributing cause was that the design of the bus housing is not <br />optimum for the application because it is susceptible to corrosion leading to water intrusion. <br />The root cause of the damaged cable insulation was failure to specify and use a depth-limiting cutting tool <br />for removing semiconducting material from cable insulation. When workers removed semiconducting <br />material from the cable during initial installation of the cable termination stress cone, the underlying cable <br />dielectric insulation was scored, reducing its insulating effectiveness. This contributed to conditions which <br />led to an arc fault in the affected 4160-volt cable. A contributing cause was lack of a post-installation test <br />method which would be adequate to detect insulation deficiencies. <br />Safety Assessment <br />In this event, a LOOP occurred on Unit 1 emergency busses El and E2 due to lockout of the SAT and <br />interruption of power to the UAT. The reactor was immediately and safely shut down by manual scram in <br />accordance with station operating procedures. The RCIC system and HPCI system operated as designed <br />and controlled reactor water level and pressure, respectively. All four station EDGs started as expected, <br />and EDGs 1 and 2 supplied power to affected emergency busses El and E2. Unit 2 busses E3 and E4 <br />were not affected by the event, and they remained powered by their normal, offsite sources. In addition, <br />the site's supplemental diesel generator was available and could have been used if necessary to mitigate <br />the event. The SAT was not damaged by the event. The UAT remained available for backfeed, and <br />backfeed was implemented per procedure during the event. All safety systems operated per design in <br />response to the event. <br />Based on the foregoing analysis, it's concluded that this event had no adverse impact on the health and <br />safety of the public. <br />Page 4 of 5 <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.
