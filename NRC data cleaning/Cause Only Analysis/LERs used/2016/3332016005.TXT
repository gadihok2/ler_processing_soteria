The fan outlet isolation damper actuator 70MOD-108A(OP) failed to give the fully-open <br />permissive signal to start the fan. Gentle pressure on the actuator linkage allowed the fan to start. Prior to this, <br />on August 16, 2016, during post-maintenance testing, 70FN-4A did not start. Troubleshooting adjusted the <br />linkage and the fan started as appropriate.

LER NUMBER <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />— 005 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />— 00 <br />YEAR <br />2016 <br />NARRATIVE <br />Background <br />The James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant (JAF) Control Room Air Conditioning (AC) System [EllS <br />identifier: VI] and the Control Room Emergency Ventilation Air Supply (CREVAS) System [VI] (a mode of the <br />Control Room AC) provides a protected environment from which occupants can control the plant during normal <br />conditions and following an uncontrolled release of radioactivity, hazardous chemicals, or smoke. <br />The Control Room AC System and CREVAS System consists of two redundant subsystems that provide <br />recirculated control room air. A single subsystem is sufficient to maintain a suitable control room environment <br />for a sustained occupancy of 20 persons. Each subsystem consists of air handling units, recirculation exhaust <br />fans, air handling unit fans, ductwork, dampers, and associated Instrumentation and controls; and, each <br />CREVAS subsystem consists of a series of filters, a control room emergency air supply fan, valves or <br />dampers, doors, barriers and instrumentation. <br />The recirculation / exhaust fans consist of two full capacity fans for the Control Room. The intake air supply is <br />mixed with air from one of the recirculation / exhaust fans before it is recirculated back to the room. One <br />Control Room exhaust fan runs at all times to support the normal or emergency mode while the other fan is on <br />standby. Normally these exhaust fans are swapped manually. An automatic start function occurs only if the <br />running exhaust fan stops. <br />This Licensee Event Report (LER) addresses the ability to start one of the Control Room recirculation / <br />exhaust fans (70FN-4A). <br />Event Description <br />On September 19, 2016, JAF was at 54 percent power when the Control Room Ventilation recirculation / <br />exhaust fan lineup was being changed to place 70FN-4A inservice when it did not start as expected. A second <br />attempt to start the fan was successful when gentle pressure was applied to assist the linkage between the <br />damper (70MOD-108A) and motor actuator (70MOD-108A(OP)). This damper is located on the outlet to <br />70FN-4A. <br />To maintain the operability of 70FN-4A, it was placed in service as the lead fan with 70FN-4B in standby. In <br />addition, a manual Operator compensatory action was developed to have an Operator dispatched to assist the <br />damper linkage in the event that an exhaust fan does not start. This compensatory action requires a short <br />transit from the Control Room to the Control Room Ventilation Equipment room. <br />Event Analysis <br />The switch in the Control Room begins the sequence to start the fan (70FN-4A) by opening its associated <br />damper (70MOD-108A). The circuit logic starts the fan after a time delay so the damper has time to open; but, <br />it only starts the fan if there is a permissive signal that the damper has fully opened. The open permissive <br />signal originates from a position switch integral / internal to the damper actuator (70MOD-108A(OP)) itself. <br />When gentle pressure was applied to assist the damper linkage during the event, it caused the actuator to <br />complete its motion and close the contact for the permissive signal and initiate the fan start. <br />Prior to this event, on August 16, 2016, 70FN-4A did not start during post maintenance testing. In addition, the <br />time delay start logic relay (70-62-1CRVA04) was found out-of-tolerance and damper position indication in the <br />Control Room was dual. Indication in the Control Room for damper position comes from position switches <br />70PNS-108A1 and 70PNS-108A2. However, these position switches are for indication only and they do not  <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) <br />	 Page 2 of 4 <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />	<br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(06-2016) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 <br />	<br />EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

LER NUMBER <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />— 005 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />— 00 <br />YEAR <br />2016 <br />provide the permissive signal. The corrective actions were to make a minor adjustment to the damper linkage, <br />lubricate and clean moving parts, and re-calibrate 70-62-1CRVA04. The damper was tested and 70FN-4A <br />started successfully with appropriate Control Room damper position indication. The damper actuator 70MOD-<br />108A(OP) was not replaced at that time. <br />After the event on September 19, 2016, the damper actuator 70MOD-108A(OP) was replaced. <br />Troubleshooting identified that the old damper actuator was slow / degraded compared to the new damper <br />actuator. If 70MOD-108A(OP) were slow or did not fully actuate the internal position switch then 70FN-4A <br />would not receive a permissive signal to start. <br />The inconsistent and degrading damper actuator performance began to affect system operability on August <br />16, 2016. This deficiency prevented the reliability of one of two redundant subsystems of the Technical <br />Specification (TS) 3.7.4 Control Room AC System and TS 3.7.3 CREVAS system. If one CREVAS subsystem <br />is inoperable then Required Action A.1 of TS 3.7.3 requires that it be restored within 7 days. If the completion <br />time of Condition A were not met then Required Action C.1 requires that the plant be in Mode 3 within 12 <br />hours and subsequently be in Mode 4 within 36 hours. Similarly, if one Control Room AC System is inoperable <br />then Required Action A.1 of TS 3.7.4 requires that it be restored within 30 days. If the completion time of <br />Condition A were not met then Required Action C.1 requires that the plant be in Mode 3 within 12 hours and <br />subsequently be in Mode 4 within 36 hours. In both cases, the allowed out-of-service time was exceeded. This <br />is a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications; reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). <br />Cause <br />Degraded damper actuator 70MOD-108A(OP) affected the ability of the Control Room Ventilation recirculation <br />/ exhaust fan 70FN-4A to start reliably. <br />Similar Events <br />There were no other identical failures of 70MOD-108A(OP) historically. However, similar ventilation damper <br />actuator problems have occurred on other components. <br />April 8, 2005: The relay room exhaust isolation damper 70MOD-102A did not reach full open before the time <br />delay relay timed out. A new damper actuator was installed. (CR-JAF-2005-01396) <br />June 7, 2007: The Control Room air handling unit 70AHU-3A starts but the damper 70MOD-106A did not <br />appear to be opening. This was caused by the damper actuator and was corrected when it was replaced. (CR-<br />JAF-2007-02124) <br />August 5, 2011: The control room supply fan 70AHU-3A discharge damper 70MOD-106A will not open on <br />initiation of fan start. This was caused by inadequate damper and damper linkage lubrication which increased <br />the resistance to proper damper actuator performance.

During <br />this time, the "B" Control Room exhaust fan remained available to perform the required safety function. This <br />deficiency affected the redundant "A" Control Room exhaust fan to start reliably; either, manually or <br />automatically in response to a failure of the "B" exhaust fan. <br />If the "A" Control Room exhaust fan was needed, and did not start, a plant Operator could manually correct the <br />deficiency by traveling to the damper actuator location and locally assisting the damper linkage. When the <br />deficiency was identified in September 2016, this manual Operator action was evaluated and accepted as a <br />compensatory measure. Based on the calculated accumulated doses which could be received in these areas <br />for the various design basis accidents combined with the relatively short period of time needed to perform this <br />compensatory action, the increase in dose that could be incurred during the performance of this compensatory <br />action would be negligible when compared to the dose that would be received by maintaining continuous <br />occupancy in the Control Room. <br />References <br />• Condition Report: CR-JAF-2016-03593, September 19, 2016 <br />• Condition Report: CR-JAF-2016-03116, August 16, 2016 <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) <br />	 Page 4 of 4<br /></span>
