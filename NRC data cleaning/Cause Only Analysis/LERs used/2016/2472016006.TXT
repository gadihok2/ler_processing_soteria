(ENO) hereby provides <br />Licensee Event Report (LER) 2016-006-00. The attached LER identifies an event where <br />there was a Technical Specification (TS) Prohibited Condition due to an inoperable 138 kV <br />offsite power system caused by the Station Auxiliary Transformer (SAT) Load Tap Changer <br />(LTC) not capable of automatically adjusting voltage to maintain required voltage as a result <br />of finding the Safety Injection signal links disconnected. Technical Specification 3.8.1 (AC <br />Sources Operating) specifies, in part, that two qualified circuits between the offsite <br />transmission network and the onsite AC Electrical Power distribution system shall be <br />operable. Operability of the offsite power sources requires the ability to provide the required <br />capacity during design basis conditions. The AC electrical distribution system relies on the <br />SAT LTC to automatically adjust the voltage on 480 volt vital busses for the system to <br />perform as designed. This condition is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). This <br />condition was recorded in the Entergy Corrective Action Program as Condition Report CR-<br />1P2-2016-02293. <br />NL-16-061 <br />Page 2 of 2 <br />There are no new commitments identified in this letter.

ABSTRACT (Limit to 1400 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced type written lines) 	 . <br />On March 9, 2016, during shutdown for a refueling outage, while performing testing of the <br />safety injection (SI) system, the Station Auxiliary Transformer (SAT) Load Tap Changer <br />(LTC) failed to increase per design upon actuation of an SI signal. 	 The condition was <br />acceptable for the current mode but is unacceptable when the offsite AC electric power <br />distribution and SI System is required to be operable. 	 An investigation was performed <br />and it was discovered on March 28, 2016, that the SAT control cabinet terminal blocks <br />W105 and W106 had their links open thereby preventing proper operation of the LTC. 	 A <br />review of tests and Work Orders (WO) did not identify any previous failed tests or any WO <br />with instructions to open the links. 	 The last successful test of LTC operation was <br />performed on February 26, 2014. 	 The direct cause of the event was open links for the SAT <br />LTC SI signal. 	 The most probable apparent cause was maintenance activities by either <br />IPEC or supplemental personnel that left the SAT states links W105 and W106 open during <br />the 2014 spring outage (2R21). 	 A review was performed of 42 Work Order (WO) tasks <br />conducted during the 2014 spring outage. 	 None of the WO tasks required work on the SAT <br />LTC links or required work in the specific area of the states links. 	 Corrective actions <br />included closure of the SAT LTC Terminal Block states links and testing. 	 The control <br />links for the Unit 3 SAT will be inspected to verify they are in the correct position. <br />All troubleshooting work orders will require concurrent verification that any equipment <br />manipulation is restored to its original configuration. 	 The SAT LTC Preventive <br />Maintenance (PM) procedure will be revised to insure steps are added to require <br />independent verification for all LTC SI logic control link manipulation. 	 The event had <br />no significant effect on public health and safety.. <br />NRC FORM366AU.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(01-2014) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />FACILITY NAME (1) DOCKET (2) LER NUMBER (6) PAGE (3) <br />YEAR <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER  <br />REVISION <br />NUMBER <br />Indian Point Unit 2  05000-247 2016 	 006 	 00  2 OF 4 <br />NARRATIVE (If more space is required, use additional copies of NRC Form 366A) (17) <br />Note: 	 The Energy Industry Identification System Codes are identified within the <br />brackets {1. <br />DESCRIPTION OF EVENT <br />On March 9, 2016, during shutdown for a refueling outage, while performing testing of <br />the safety injection (SI) system in accordance with 2-PT-R013 (Safety Injection), the <br />Station Auxiliary Transformer (SAT) {FK} Load Tap Changer (LTC) {TTC} failed to <br />increase per design upon actuation of an SI signal {BQ}. The condition was acceptable <br />for the current mode but is unacceptable when the offsite AC electric power <br />distribution and SI System is required to be operable (Mode 4 and above). An <br />investigation was performed and it was discovered on March 28, 2016, that the SAT <br />control cabinet {CAB}, terminal blocks {BLit} W105 and W106 in terminal box BA3 had <br />their links open thereby preventing proper operation of the LTC. A review of tests and <br />Work Orders (WO) did not identify any previous failed tests or any WO with instructions <br />to open the links. The last successful test of LTC operation was performed on February <br />26, 2014. The event in which the SAT LTC failed to operate correctly during testing <br />was recorded in the Indian Point Energy Center corrective action program (CAP) as CR-<br />IP2-2016-01386. The condition where the SAT control cabinet terminal block links were <br />discovered open was recorded in the CAP as CR-IP2-2016-02293. <br />The SAT is part of the plant AC Electrical Power Distribution System which consists of <br />two offsite circuits (a 138 kV circuit and a 13.8 kV circuit), each of which has a <br />preferred and a backup feeder. The onsite AC standby power circuit consists of three <br />Emergency Diesel Generators. The plant electrical distribution system is configured <br />around 6.9 kV buses Nos. 1,2,3,4,5 and 6. All offsite power to the 480 volt safeguards <br />buses enters the plant via 6.9 kV buses 5 and 6 which are normally connected to the 138 <br />kV offsite circuit but have the ability to be connected to the 13.8 kV offsite circuit. <br />The 138 kV offsite circuit consists of either 138"kV feeder 95332 (preferred feeder) or <br />138 kV feeder 95331 (backup feeder) and 138 kV/6.9 kV SAT including the automatic tap <br />changer, circuit breakers ST5 and ST6 which supply 6.9 kV buses 5 and 6. When the plant <br />is operating, 6.9 kV buses 1,2,3 and 4 typically receive power from the main generator <br />via the Unit Auxiliary Transformer (UAT). However, when the main generator or UAT is <br />not capable of supporting this configuration, 6.9 kV buses 1 and 2 receive offsite <br />power via bus 5 and 6.9 kV buses 3 and 4 receive offsite power via 6.9 kV bus 6. <br />Following a unit trip, 6.9 kV buses 1,2,3 and 4 will auto transfer (dead fast transfer) <br />to 6.9 kV buses 5 and 6 in order to receive offsite power. The 6.9 kV buses Nos. 2,3,5 <br />and 6 supply power to the 480 volts safeguards power buses (5A, 6A, 2A and 3A) using <br />6.9 kV/480 volt Station Service Transformers (SSTs). <br />The SAT is a 138 kV/6.9 kV transformer with the primary function to provide electric <br />power to 6.9 kV buses 5 and 6 during on-line operations and 6.9 kV auxiliary buses 1 <br />through 6 during shutdown and startup modes of operations. The SAT and UAT have <br />automatic load tap changers (LTC), which is operated under load to maintain the <br />secondary voltage at 6.9 kV. The SAT LTC is used to mitigate the fast transfer of 6.9 <br />kV system from buses 1 through 4 to buses 5 and 6. This fast transfer typically will <br />cause a voltage drop across the transformer. With the LTC in automatic and responding <br />after 2 seconds, this voltage will be restored in 1 minute. In November 2002, the SAT <br />LTC had a tap changer control circuit modification to enhance the voltage profile by <br />raising taps on initiation of an SI signal. Upon initiation of a SI signal the new <br />circuit takes over control of the voltage setpoint and increases the setpoint that <br />increases voltage towards a pre-selected voltage. <br />The SAT LTC will begin to automatically raise taps to increase secondary voltage in <br />anticipation of the increased loading that will occur thirty seconds later when the 6.9 <br />kV buses 1,2,3 and 4 automatically transfer (fast transfer) to the offsite power <br />supply. The relays in this circuit are located in a box mounted on the outside of the <br />tap changer control cubical. <br />NRC FORM 366AU.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(01-2014) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />FACILITY NAME (1)  DOCKET (2)  LER NUMBER (6) 	 PAGE (3) <br />YEAR <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER  <br />REVISION <br />NUMBER <br />Indian Point Unit 2  05000-247  2016 	 006 	 00 1 3 	 OF 4 <br />The operability of the AC electrical power sources is consistent with the initial <br />assumptions of the accident analysis and is based upon meeting the design basis of the <br />unit. This results in maintaining at least 2 of 3 safeguards power trains energized <br />from either offsite or onsite AC sources during accident conditions in the event of 1) <br />An assumed loss of all offsite power or all onsite AC power and 2) A worst case single <br />failure. Two qualified circuits between the offsite transmission network and the <br />onsite electrical power system and separate and independent diesel generators for each <br />train ensure availability of the required power to shut down the reactor and maintain <br />it in a safe shutdown condition after an anticipated operational occurrence or a <br />postulated Design Basis Accident. <br />During the physical restoration of the associated states links it was noted that <br />"positive force" was required to move the sliding portion of the link back into <br />position, which does not support a potential conclusion that the links vibrated loose <br />and opened due to the normal operating vibration of the transformer. The lack of <br />specific work instructions for this component and the need to apply "positive force" <br />to reclose the links indicates that the links were likely to have been deliberately <br />opened during a maintenance activity. I&C and Engineering reviewed 42 work order <br />tasks (including feeder trip checks associated with the station aux transformer) <br />performed during the 2R21 refueling outages but did not identify any which <br />specifically directed states links W105 and W106 to be opened. No evidence of online <br />work was found which would have established a time of inoperability. <br />An extent of condition (EOC) review of station transformers was conducted and the only <br />SSC on/in which a high risk condition exists is on the U3 Station Aux Transformer. <br />All SI functions tests have been successful on this transformer; however, it is <br />prudent to verify the position of the SI control links on this transformer. <br />Cause of Event <br />The direct cause of the event was that SAT LTC Control Cabinet Terminal Blocks W105 <br />and W106 had open links for the SAT LTC SI signal. An evaluation of the blocks <br />determined they require positive force to open. An investigation determined the last <br />documented successful test of SAT LTC SI functionality was February 26, 2014 (prior <br />refueling outage). The most probable apparent cause was maintenance activities by <br />either IPEC or supplemental personnel that left the SAT states links W105 and W106 <br />open during the 2014 spring outage (2R21). A review was performed of 42 Work Order <br />(WO) tasks conducted during the 2014 spring outage. None of the WO tasks required <br />work on the SAT LTC links or required work in the specific area of the states links. <br />A review was performed on the SAT I&C procedure for instrument calibrations and no <br />documented manipulation of SAT links was identified. Prior functionality testing has <br />been satisfactory. Additional investigations are being performed to identify the <br />specific cause. <br />Corrective Actions <br />The following corrective actions that will be or have been performed under Entergy's <br />Corrective Action Program to address the. cause: <br />• The SAT LTC Terminal Block links were closed and testing completed satisfactorily. <br />• The control links for the Unit 3 SAT will be inspected to verify they are in the <br />correct position. <br />• All troubleshooting work orders will require concurrent verification that any <br />equipment manipulation is restored to its original configuration. <br />• The SAT LTC Preventive Maintenance (PM) procedure will be revised to insure steps <br />are added to require independent verification for all LTC SI logic control link <br />manipulation. <br />NRC FORM 366AU.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(01-2014) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />FACILITY NAME (1) DOCKET (2) LER NUMBER (6) PAGE (3) <br />YEAR <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER  <br />REVISION <br />NUMBER - <br />Indian Point Unit 2  05000-247  2016 	 006 	 00  4 OF 4 <br />NARRATIVE (If more space is required, use additional copies of NRC Form 366A) (17) <br />Event Analysis <br />The event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). The licensee shall report any <br />operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's TS. This condition meets <br />the reporting criteria because Technical Specification 3.8.1 (AC Sources-Operating) <br />specifies the following AC electrical sources to be operable in modes 1,2,3 and 4: <br />1) Two qualified circuits between the offsite transmission network and the onsite AC <br />electrical power distribution system, and 2) Three diesel generators capable of <br />supplying the onsite power distribution subsystem. <br />TS 3.8.1 has a Note that the automatic transfer function for the 6.9 kV buses shall be <br />operable whenever the 138 kV offsite circuit is supplying 6.9 kV bus 5 and 6 and the <br />UAT is supplying 6.9 kV buses 1,2,3 and 4. Qualified offsite circuits are those that <br />are described in the UFSAR and are part of the licensing basis for the unit. Each <br />offsite circuit must be capable of maintaining rated frequency and voltage, and <br />accepting required loads during an accident, while connected to the Engineered Safety <br />Features buses. UFSAR Section 7.5.2.1.12.1 discusses the SAT LTC SI signal feature. <br />With the SAT LTC SI actuation signal disconnected, the 138 kV offsite circuit is no <br />longer a qualified circuit therefore is inoperable. With the as-found LTC condition, <br />an event resulting in an SI and fast bus transfer could cause the secondary voltage to <br />drop below the degraded voltage setpoint for more than 10 seconds, resulting in a <br />separation of the safety buses from offsite power (LOOP). <br />Past Similar Events <br />A review was performed of the past three years of Licensee Event Reports (LERs) for <br />events reporting a TS violation due to inoperable 138 kV offsite power distribution <br />system. No LERs were identified. <br />Safety Significance <br />This event had no effect on the health and safety of the public. There were no actual <br />safety consequences for the event because there were no accidents or events during the <br />degraded condition. <br />There were no significant potential safety consequences of this event. <br />A probabilistic risk evaluation was performed for failure of the SAT LTC to increase <br />to the required voltage following actuation of a SI signal._The risk evaluation for <br />the SAT LTC boosting function involved estimating the increase in core damage <br />frequency (CDF) and large early release frequency (LERF) using a baseline case which <br />only includes initiating events that generate an SI signal. Pending the outcome of <br />further investigations, the time of consideration was conservatively determined to be <br />since the SAT LTC was last verified to be operable for SI actuations on February 26, <br />2014. Even in this situation, the results of the risk evaluation concluded the risk <br />impact associated with the failure of the SAT LTC to increase voltage following an SI <br />signal is non-risk significant per NRC Regulatory Guide 1.174 (i.e., the increase in <br />CDF is less than 1E-6/year and the increase in LERF is less than 1E-7/year).<br /></span>
