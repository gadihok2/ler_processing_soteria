Background <br />Enforcement Guidance Memorandum (EGM) 15-002, "Enforcement Discretion for Tornado-<br />Generated Missile Protection Noncompliance," provides guidance to exercise enforcement <br />discretion when an operating power reactor licensee does not comply with a plant's current <br />site-specific licensing basis for tornado-generated missile protection. Specifically, discretion <br />would apply to the applicable technical specification (TS) limiting condition(s) for operation <br />(LCO) which would require a reactor shutdown or mode change; if a licensee could not meet <br />TS LCO required action(s) within the TS completion time. <br />Interim Staff Guidance DSS•lSG-2016.01, "Clarification of Licensee Actions in Receipt of <br />Enforcement Discretion Per Enforcement Guidance Memorandum EGM 15-002," provides <br />interim staff guidance (ISG) intended to facilitate NRC staff understanding of the expectations <br />for consistent oversight associated with implementing enforcement discretion for tornado <br />missile protection noncompliance(s) per EGM 15-002. <br />Appendix A to DSS-ISG-2016-01 provides guidance for acceptable initial and comprehensive <br />compensatory measures for licensee use in implementing the enforcement discretion outlined <br />in EGM 15-002. The licensee is expected to document (log) the utilization of EGM 15-002, <br />inform the resident inspector, and enter the issue into the corrective action program. For initial <br />compensatory measures, it is expected that the measures listed are already in place at sites <br />that may be affected by severe weather, such as tornadoes and/or hurricane force winds. The <br />measures provided should be verified as current and readily deployable within a very short <br />timeframe (the shortest timeframe could, in some scenarios, be dictated by a (TS) 3.0.3 <br />completion time of one hour). <br />B. Plant Status <br />At the time the condition was discovered, ANO-1 was operating in Mode 1 at 100% power. <br />There were no other structures, systems, or components that were inoperable at the time that <br />contributed to the event. <br />C. Event Description <br />ANO conducted walk downs and design verifications as extent of condition activities in <br />response to compromised external flood boundaries which were previously identified at the <br />station.

If a means used to impose an information <br />collection does not display a currently valid OMB control number, the NRC may <br />not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, the <br />information collection. <br />2016 -- 002 -- 00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />In June 2016, as part of the extent of condition actions, a list of potential tornado missile <br />protection vulnerabilities was being created to determine if there were any differences <br />between design documentation and actual plant configuration for areas that could be <br />impacted by tornado missiles. On June 13, 2016, a tornado generated missile vulnerability <br />was identified for Door 77 and some of the Safety Related Systems, Structures or <br />Components (SSCs) in the Unit 1 Upper South Electrical Penetration Room. Specifically, <br />there is a potential deficiency associated with the missile shield wall inside this room. A <br />horizontal tornado generated missile could penetrate the hollow metal door and then <br />penetrate the unqualified concrete masonry unit (CMU) wall before striking safety related <br />cables. <br />Follow-up field inspection confirmed the block wall to be 12 inches thick with some ungrouted <br />cells and the original design requires 18 inches of grouted block wall for missile barriers <br />therefore the wall was not qualified to withstand all postulated missile strikes. The cabling <br />supplying the following components that could be impacted by a tornado missile: <br />• Reactor Protection System (RPS) Channel C: (hot leg temperature from Loop B of the <br />Reactor Coolant System (RCS) and the power range). <br />• Engineered Safeguards Actuation System (ESAS) Analog Channel 3: (Reactor <br />Building (RB) Pressure signal and 'B' Loop RCS Pressure signal). <br />• Emergency Feedwater Initiation and Control (EFIC) Channel C: (low and high range <br />level and pressure signals from each of the two steam generators). <br />• Main Steam Line Isolation (MSLI) Valves. <br />The RPS initiates a reactor trip, if necessary, to protect core fuel design limits and the RCS <br />pressure boundary during abnormalities while the ESAS initiates necessary safety systems, <br />based on the values of selected unit parameters to protect against violating core design limits <br />and to mitigate accidents. The EFIC system instrumentation is designed to protect against <br />the consequences of a simultaneous blowdown of bother steam generators. One of the <br />signals that the EFIC instrumentation generates is MSLI. <br />Unit 1 TS 3.3.1 addresses the RPS system required actions and completion times. TS 3.3.5 <br />addresses the actions and completion times associated with ESAS. Unit 1 TS 3.3.11 <br />provides the required actions and completion times for the EFIC system. This includes the <br />MSLI signals. <br />Page 3 of 7 <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />1. FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET 6.

The immediate actions <br />were performed for these components as required by the TSs. The guidance provided in <br />EGM 15-002 was utilized to address the prompt operability and reportability of this condition. <br />D. Event Causes <br />This is a design legacy issue. The cause of this issue was a lack of clarity and changing <br />requirements during the original licensing of the plant that led to inadequate understanding of <br />the original regulatory guidance. <br />E. Corrective Actions <br />The following corrective actions have been completed to address this condition: <br />ANO directive Enforcement Discretion (COPD-038) was implemented in preparation <br />for use of EGM 15-002. Actions were completed to comply with the requirements of <br />EGM 15-002. <br />Log entries were made documenting the inoperability and subsequent transition to <br />operable but nonconforming equipment status for the affected SSCs. The initial <br />briefing actions were also completed and logged including NRC resident brief. <br />• All cells of the CMU missile shield wall located inside Door 77 in Room 144 were <br />grouted. <br />• Completed a calculation that verified the fully grouted 12 inch CMU wall will stop <br />penetration of the applicable tornado generated missiles. <br />The following corrective actions are being taken to further address this condition: <br />Prepare an Engineering Change (EC) to enhance the wall to meet design basis for <br />tornado missile loading. In lieu of preparing this EC, a Risk Base Evaluation may be <br />performed to address this vulnerability. <br />Implement the EC to enhance the wall to meet design basis tornado missile loadings. <br />In lieu of installing this EC, submit a Risk Based Evaluation for required regulatory <br />approvals. <br />Page 4 of 7 <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />1.

Safety Consequences: <br />Unit 1 is required to be protected from tornado generated missiles as applied within the unit's <br />design and licensing basis. The safety-related instrumentation required to mitigate the <br />consequences of a tornado event could have potentially been affected by this condition. <br />During a postulated design basis tornado, this could have resulted in the loss of one or more <br />of the SSCs listed above under Event Description. <br />The regulation in 10 CFR 50.36(c)(2) outlines LCOs in the TSs. Certain TSs contain LCO <br />statements that include action statements (required actions and their associated completion <br />time) to provide constraints on the length of time components or systems may remain <br />inoperable or out of service before the plant must be shut down or other compensatory <br />measures must be taken. Such time constraints are based on the safety significance of the <br />component or system being removed from service. <br />EGM 15-002, in providing the basis for granting the enforcement discretion states that, in <br />general, tornado missile scenarios that may lead to core damage are very low probability <br />events because safety-related SSCs are typically designed to withstand the effects of <br />tornados. For a tornado missile induced scenario to occur, a tornado would have to impact the <br />site and result in the generation of missiles that would contact and fail vulnerable, unprotected <br />safety related equipment and/or unprotected safety related subcomponents in a manner that <br />is not immediately repairable or recoverable. In addition, because plants are designed with <br />redundancy and diversity, the tornado missiles would have to affect multiple trains of safety <br />systems and/or means of achieving safe shutdown. <br />EMG 15-002 states that the NRC completed a generic risk analysis of potential tornado <br />missile protection non compliances to examine the risk significance of these scenarios. The <br />generic nature of this analysis did not afford the staff the capability to assess plant-specific <br />tornado missile protections which likely exist at many reactors that would result in lower risk <br />determinations, and it did not consider the plant-specific nature of the non-compliances or the <br />redundancies of SSCs. The generic analysis assumed that core damage would occur if a <br />tornado hit a plant located in the most active tornado region in the country and that it caused a <br />tornado-generated missile to fail all emergency core cooling equipment at the plant with no <br />ability to recover. <br />Page 5 of 7 <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />1.

If a means used to impose an information <br />collection does not display a currently valid OMB control number, the NRC may <br />not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, the <br />information collection. <br />2016 -- 002 -- 00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />Further, the study did not account for a number of conservatisms. For example, whereas the <br />study assumed the failure of redundant systems due to tornado generated missiles, actual <br />spatial configurations of redundant systems at a plant could lower the probability of complete <br />system failures as a result of tornado generated missiles. Additionally, some tornado <br />generated missiles may not cause system failures at all or may cause failures that are <br />repairable or recoverable within a reasonable time frame. <br />In summary, EGM 15-002 stated that the generic bounding risk analysis performed by the <br />NRC concluded that this issue is of low risk significance. Therefore, enforcement discretion <br />until June 10, 2018, will not impose significant additional risk to public health and safety. <br />This condition had no actual safety consequences impacting plant or public safety since ANO <br />has not experience a tornado missile event. <br />G. Basis for Reportability: <br />This event is reported pursuant to the following criteria: <br />10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B): Any operation or condition which was prohibited by the <br />plant's Technical Specifications. <br />The guidance provided in NUREG 1022 states: <br />An LER is required if a condition existed for a time longer than permitted by the TS <br />(i.e., greater than the total allowable restoration and shutdown outage time (or <br />completion time in the STS)), even if the condition was not discovered until after the <br />allowable time had elapsed and the condition was rectified immediately upon <br />discovery. <br />H. Additional Information: <br />10 CFR 50.73(b)(5) states that this report shall contain reference to "any previous similar <br />events at the same plant that are known to the licensee." NUREG-1022 reporting guidance <br />states that term "previous occurrences" should include previous events or conditions that <br />involved the same underlying concern or reason as this event, such as the same root cause, <br />failure, or sequence of events. <br />Page 6 of 7 <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />Page 7 of 7 <br />NRC FORM 366A U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 <br />	<br />EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: <br />80 hours.
