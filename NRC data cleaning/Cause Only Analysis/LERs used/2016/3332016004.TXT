FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant was <br />operating at 100% power. A fault in transformer 71T-5 caused a trip of circuit breaker 71-10340. Power was lost to 2 of 3 <br />Reactor Building Closed Loop Cooling (RBCLC) pumps and 2 of 3 lube oil pumps for the Motor-Generator (MG) Set for 'A' <br />Reactor Water Recirculation (RWR). The 'A' RWR pump tripped immediately causing reactor power to reduce to <br />approximately 50%. The remaining RBCLC pump was inadequate to maintain the MG Set fluid drive oil temperature for the <br />'B' RWR pump so Operators initiated a manual scram at 1236. This event is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A). <br />The power loss also affected Reactor Building Ventilation (RBV). This system supports the requirement of Technical <br />Specification Surveillance Requirement 3.6.4.1.1 for a differential pressure in Secondary Containment. At the loss of RBV, <br />Secondary Containment automatically isolated and the Standby Gas Treatment system was manually initiated. However, <br />during this short transition the differential pressure requirement was not met. This report is being submitted per 10 CFR <br />50.73(a)(2)(v)(C). <br />The apparent cause of the 71T-5 fault was inadequate preventative maintenance which allowed the transformer to remain <br />in service beyond expected service life. <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016) <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />	<br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(06-2016) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 <br />	<br />EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

LER NUMBER <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />— 004 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />— 00 <br />YEAR <br />2016 <br />NARRATIVE <br />Background <br />James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant (JAF) 600V electrical distribution system [El IS identifier: EC] is <br />supplied by stepping down 4160V to 600V through one of twelve transformers (T-5 to T-16). Nonsafety-related <br />electrical busses are supplied by T-5 to 1-12 and safety-related electrical buses by 1-13 to T16. (See Figure: <br />Electrical Distribution). <br />A transformer uses a type of cellulose paper insulation between windings. The insulator material must have a <br />large enough dielectric property to prevent electrical breakdown under high voltages. Electrical faults can <br />occur if the insulator material degrades or becomes damaged. Many outdoor transformers are liquid-immersed <br />using a highly refined mineral oil that cools and insulates the windings. Since electrical faults could breakdown <br />the oil into combustible gases, extra fire protection measures are needed when using them indoors. Dry-type <br />transformers use air cooling instead of oil. Both dry-type and liquid-immersed transformers are often self-<br />cooled by natural convection. As power ratings increase, transformers are often cooled by forced-air cooling, <br />forced-oil cooling, water-cooling, or combinations of these. All twelve 4160V to 600V transformers at JAF are <br />dry-type and force-air cooled except T-5 and T-13 which are dry-type and convection cooled. <br />This licensee event report (LER) addresses an electrical fault in T-5 caused by insulation breakdown. <br />Event Description <br />On June 24, 2016, at 12:05, when JAF was operating at 100% power, several 600V electrical busses lost <br />power. A fault in 71T-5 caused breaker 10340 to trip. This breaker connects 4160V to four transformers which <br />each provide power to a 600V bus: 11300 (L-13), 12300 (L-23), 13300 (L-33), and 14300 (L-43). These <br />electric buses provide power to a variety of nonsafety-related plant loads; notable equipment include: <br />• Reactor Water Recirculation (RWR) [AD], 2 of 3 Motor-Generator (MG) Set lube oil pumps for "A" recirc <br />pump and 1 of 3 MG Set lube oil pumps for "B" recirc pump. <br />• Reactor Building Closed Loop Cooling (RBCLC) [CC], 2 of 3 pumps <br />• Fuel Pool Cooling [DA], 1 of 2 recirculation pumps <br />• Reactor Building Ventilation (RBV) [VA], 2 of 3 supply fans and 2 of 4 exhaust fans <br />• Service Air [LF], Instrument Air [LD], and Breathing Air [LH], 2 of 3 air compressors <br />• Reactor Water Cleanup [CE], 1 of 2 pumps <br />Immediately following breaker 10340 trip "A" RWR pump tripped causing reactor power to decrease to <br />approximately 50%. MG Set fluid drive oil temperature for the "B" RWR pump began to rise because the single <br />RBCLC pump was insufficient to maintain its temperature. <br />Three of four nonsafety-related 600V electric buses affected by this event were crossed tied to the other four <br />nonsafety-related 600V electric buses. This was not done for L-13 since the source of the fault was not known <br />during the event. <br />When power was lost to RBV fans, Secondary Containment [NG] automatically isolated and differential <br />pressure began to degrade. Standby Gas Treatment (SBGT) [BH] was manually initiated and differential <br />pressure was restored by 12:19. <br />At 12:36, Operators initiated a manual scram. The event was reported to the NRC as ENS 52042. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) <br />	 Page 2 of 5 <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />	<br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(06-2016) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 <br />	<br />EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

LER NUMBER <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />— 004 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />— 00 <br />YEAR <br />2016 <br />Event Analysis <br />Secondary Containment <br />The RBV supports the requirement of Technical Specification Surveillance Requirement 3.6.4.1.1 for a <br />differential pressure in Secondary Containment. With the loss of RBV, Secondary Containment was <br />automatically isolated and the SBGT was manually initiated, as designed. However, during this short transition <br />the differential pressure requirement was not met. This condition could have prevented the fulfillment of a <br />safety function to control the release of radioactive material; reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C). <br />System Actuations  <br />Reactor Protection System (RPS) was actuated by a manual scram, resulting in all control rods inserting <br />successfully. This event resulted in the actuation of RPS and containment isolations in multiple systems; <br />reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A). <br />71T-5 Service Life  <br />The insulation system of a dry type transformer under the combined thermal, electrical, mechanical, and <br />environmental stresses undergoes gradual deterioration, which ultimately leads to transformer failure. The life <br />expectancy of insulation decreases with higher temperatures. A typical life span for dry-type transformers is <br />more than 20 years. As discussed in the similar events section, 71T-5 failed in 1992 after 19 years of service. <br />It was refurbished and used for 24 years until the failure described in this LER. <br />Although 71T-5 loading varies based on operational needs, the typical load is between 700 KVA and 900 KVA <br />with a possibility of exceeding the 1000 KVA limit for short periods from additional intermittent loads. <br />Transformer 71T-5 has the highest continuous load of all the 600 VAC sub-station switchgear transformers at <br />JAF. <br />The preventive maintenance (PM) of 71T-5 included inspection, cleaning and insulation resistance testing. <br />This PM was last performed in 2002. These PM practices alone would not have mitigated the effects of <br />transformer load on transformer life; however, it may have alerted the station to evidence of load induced <br />overheating as well as provided "cleaning" which, can reduce heat induced failures. <br />A review of the preventative and predictive maintenance strategies for large dry-type transformers was <br />performed which included EPRI (Electric Power Research Institute), fleet and industry. For the classification of <br />71T-5, EPRI would not recommend any tasks be performed. However, other industry best practice PM <br />templates included more extensive electrical tests (i.e. Doble test, polarization, exciting current, core ground, <br />surge comparison), annual thermography, and more frequent cleaning, inspecting, and operator walkdowns. <br />Cause <br />The direct cause of the manual scram and secondary containment differential pressure excursion was a fault <br />on the primary side windings on 71T-5. The apparent cause of the 71T-5 fault was inadequate preventative <br />maintenance which allowed the transformer to remain in service beyond expected service life. <br />Similar Events <br />On June 23, 1992 (LER-92-034-01), 71T-5 failed during relatively high electrical loads after being in service <br />since 1973. The heat from the fully loaded transformer could have contributed to the dielectric breakdown of <br />the insulation due to aging, resulting in faults. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) <br />	 Page 3 of 5 <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />	<br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(06-2016) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 <br />	<br />EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

LER NUMBER <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />— 004 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />— 00 <br />YEAR <br />2016 <br />711-5 was refurbished in August 1992 rather than being replaced with a transformer that included forced air <br />cooling, as was the case for all the other 600 VAC sub-station switchgear transformers (with exception of 71T-<br />13). Replacement with a forced air cooled transformer could have reduced the effects of load on aging. After <br />this event, corrective actions replaced or refurbished other dry-type transformers. <br />FAILED COMPONENT IDENTIFICATION: <br />Manufacturer: 	 General Electric <br />Manufacturer Model Number: 	 G-853181A <br />NPRDS Manufacturer Code: 	 G080 <br />NPRDS Component Code: 	 XFMR <br />FitzPatrick Component ID: 	 711-5  <br />Corrective Actions <br />Completed Actions <br />• 711-5 was replaced with forced air cooled dry-type transformer. <br />Future Actions <br />• Send failed 711-5 for vendor failure analysis. <br />• Replace 711-13 with forced air cooled dry-type transformer. This is the last remaining 4160/600V <br />transformer without forced air cooling. <br />• Develop Preventative Maintenance and System Monitoring for all large dry-type (4160/600V) <br />transformers based on adopting industry best practices. <br />Safety Significance <br />There was no actual radiological or nuclear safety consequence during this event. <br />Associated with the plant trip was the catastrophic failure of Condensate Booster Pump "C" (33P-9C). There <br />was no actual industrial safety consequence but it was a potential personnel hazard. <br />In addition, an environmental consequence related to the plant trip included a hydrogen seal oil discharge to <br />Lake Ontario. This discharge did not include any radiological release. <br />Although the transformer fault resulted in a manual scram, the only power loss was to non-vital systems. All <br />emergency electrical buses remained available from both off-site and emergency diesel generator power. <br />The potential for a radiological consequence was only applicable during the time period that Secondary <br />Containment did meet the 0.25 inches vacuum water gauge. A higher Reactor Building pressure could allow <br />for the exfiltration of radioactive material during an accident. However, the release would still be detected by <br />radiation monitors and this would initiate a Secondary Containment isolation. This event did not adversely <br />impact that ability of RBV to isolate or SBGT to initiate and maintain a sufficient differential pressure. <br />Therefore, the capability of Secondary Containment to mitigate the consequence of an accident was not <br />affected by this event. <br />References <br />• Condition Report: CR-JAF-2016-02245, Scram Root Cause Evaluation <br />• LER: LER-92-034-01, Engineered Safety Feature Actuations due to Transformer Failure <br />• Condition Report: CR-JAF-2016-02246, Catastrophic failure of "C" Condensate Boaster Pump <br />• Condition Report: CR-JAF-2016-02284, Hydrogen Seal Oil leak  <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) <br />	 Page 4 of 5 <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) Page 5 of 5 <br />EDG EDG <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />	<br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(06-2016) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 <br />	<br />EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.
