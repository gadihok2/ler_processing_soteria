EXPECTED <br />SUBMISSION <br />DATE <br />MONTH DAY YEAR <br />ABSTRACT (Limit to 1400 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) <br />On July 21, 2016, Units 1 and 2 were in Mode 1 (i.e., Run mode) at 100 percent of rated thermal power. At <br />that time, Engineering personnel determined that a conduit in the Emergency Diesel Generator building was <br />vulnerable to a tornado missile. The conduit contains cables associated with Unit 2 Nuclear Service Water <br />(NSW) pump "B". If the cables were disabled by a tornado missile, NSW pump 2B would be inoperable. The <br />plants' Technical Specifications (TS) require three of the site's four NSW pumps to be operable. Thus, any <br />of the other NSW pumps removed from service for longer than the TS-allowed out of service time would be <br />a condition prohibited by the TS. It has been found that this condition occurred. Enforcement Guidance <br />Memorandum (EGM) 15-002 was implemented, and NSW pump 2B was considered operable but <br />nonconforming. The tornado missile vulnerability has existed since original plant construction. Immediate <br />compensatory measures included verifying that station procedures address tornadoes, high winds, and <br />potential loss of vulnerable equipment, and confirming or receiving training on procedures to be used if a <br />tornado watch or warning is issued. Planned corrective actions include implementing more comprehensive <br />compensatory actions and permanently eliminating the vulnerability to a tornado missile. <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016) <br />NRC <br />(06-2016)) <br />(See <br />FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />e.0 n",,,,, <br />P > c. 1 LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />c. 	 i il 	 . 	 , 	 . <br />t,,,, . 	 .d • 	 CONTINUATION SHEET <br />NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.qov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nureqs/staff/sr1022/r3/)  <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

LER NUMBER <br />Brunswick Steam Electric Plant (BSEP) YEAR SEQUENTIAL NUMBER REV NO. <br />Unit 1 05000-325 2016 - 	 004 - 	 000 <br />NARRATIVE <br />Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX]. <br />Background <br />Initial Conditions <br />On July 21, 2016, Unit 1 and Unit 2 were both in Mode 1 (i.e., Run mode) at 100 percent of rated thermal <br />power. Except as described below, no out-of-service equipment contributed to, or affected the course of, <br />this event. <br />Reportability Criteria <br />This event is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) because Units 1 and 2 were <br />operated in a condition prohibited by the Technical Specifications (TS). Specifically, the Unit 2 "B" Nuclear <br />Service Water (NSW) [BI] pump was inoperable because some of its control cables were vulnerable to a <br />postulated tornado missile. Both units' TS require at least three of four site NSW pumps to be operable <br />when the units are at power. Therefore, inoperability of the Unit 2 "B" NSW pump alone did not require <br />entry into a TS condition. 	 • <br />Inoperability of a second NSW pump constitutes a loss of one required pump. In both units' TS, Limiting <br />Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.7.2, Condition B, says that with one NSW subsystem inoperable for <br />reasons other than Condition A (i.e., one required NSW pump inoperable due to header inoperable on the <br />opposite unit), the system must be restored within seven days or be in Mode 3 (i.e., Hot Shutdown) within <br />the following 12 hours. <br />When the affected Unit 2 NSW pump was considered inoperable due to tornado missile vulnerability, and <br />an additional site NSW pump became unavailable, then the plant entered Condition B as described <br />above. In the past three years, two instances were identified in which the plant entered this condition, and <br />the time to restore compliance with the LCO exceeded seven days, twelve hours. Therefore, the plant was <br />operated in a condition prohibited by the TS. The two instances occurred as shown below. <br />Pumps Out of Service Beginning of Condition End of Condition Duration <br />2B and 1B NSW Jul 8, 2013 at 2:05 EDT Jul 19, 2013 at 1:00 EDT 10.95 days <br />2B and 1B NSW Aug 26, 2013 at 1:39 EDT Sep 5, 2013 at 5:43 EDT 10.17 days <br />This event did not result in the safety function of NSW being lost because sufficient NSW capacity <br />remained available in the two pumps that remained unaffected on each occasion. Additional cooling <br />capacity available via Conventional Service Water (CSW) [KG] pumps which can be aligned to supply the <br />NSW header. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 2 of 4 <br />5. • 	 (-1  LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />htto://www.nrc.uov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nurens/staff/sr1022/r3/)  <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(06-2016)) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collect on request: 80 hours.

The affected pump was declared to be inoperable. Immediate <br />compensatory actions were implemented in order to satisfy the conditions for enforcement discretion as <br />set forth in Enforcement Guidance Memorandum (EGM) 15-002 and Interim Staff Guidance (ISG) <br />DSS-ISG-2016-01, Appendix A. With these actions in place, NSW pump 2B was then declared to be <br />operable but nonconforming. <br />Event Causes <br />The vulnerability of the control cables for Unit 2 NSW pump "B" to a tornado missile has existed since <br />original plant construction. <br />Safety Assessment <br />The purpose of the NSW system is to provide cooling water for safety-related plant equipment such as the <br />Emergency Diesel Generators [EK] and Emergency Core Cooling System pump seals and room coolers, <br />and to serve as the Ultimate Heat Sink for the plant. Two occasions in the past three years were identified <br />in which a required NSW pump was inoperable for greater than seven days, twelve hours. During this <br />time, at least one NSW pump remained operable on each unit, ensuring the safety function was met. <br />CSW pumps were also available and can be used to supply NSW headers on both units. <br />Per EGM 15-002, the NRC has analyzed risk generically for tornado-generated missiles. The analysis <br />supports the characterization of the risk as of low significance. <br />Based on this analysis, this event had no adverse impact on the health and safety of the public. <br />Corrective Actions <br />In accordance with EGM 15-002 and Regulatory Issue Summary (RIS) 2015-06, the following <br />compensatory measures have been implemented: <br />• Procedures were verified to be in place that address high winds, tornadoes, and the potential loss of <br />equipment found to be vulnerable to, a tornado missile. <br />• Procedures were verified to be in place, and training either received or planned, for responding in the <br />event that a tornado watch or warning is issued. <br />• Procedures and equipment were verified to be in place supporting Diverse and Flexible Coping <br />Strategies (FLEX). <br />• The level of awareness by shift personnel was heightened by referencing the 2B NSW pump in shift <br />turnover notes and the discussion of non-conforming conditions. <br />More comprehensive measures will be implemented within the 60-day period specified by EGM 15-002. <br />These actions will be in place by September 19, 2016. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 3 	 of 4 <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(06-2016)) <br />-;% LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.novireading-rm/doc-collections/nureqs/staff/sr1022/r3/)  <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.
