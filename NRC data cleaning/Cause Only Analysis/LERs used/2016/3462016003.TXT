This leak was from the welded end connection of the <br />small bore ASME Section III Class 2 flexible braided piping assembly between the RCP seal and the first isolation <br />valve. <br />The most probable cause of this leak was a weld solidification through-wall crack at the flange to hose / bellows tube <br />pressure boundary weld that occurred during manufacture. The post manufacture testing was not adequate to detect <br />this extremely small pressure boundary defect. Corrective actions include inspecting the other RCP seal vent line <br />flexible hoses, replacement of RCP 1-1 seal vent line flexible piping assembly with one that passed a more stringent <br />leak test, and revising procurement requirements to incorporate this more stringent leak test. <br />This event is being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A) as degradation of a principal safety barrier and 10 CFR <br />50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as operation or condition prohibited by Technical.

LER NUMBER <br />1. FACILITY NAME <br />Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station Unit 1 <br />2. DOCKET NUMBER <br />05000-346 <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />- 003 <br />YEAR <br />2016 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX]. <br />System Description: <br />The Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station (DBNPS) Reactor Coolant System (RCS) [AB] uses four Reactor <br />Coolant Pumps (RCPs) [AB-P] to circulate the reactor coolant. Each RCP is a single-stage centrifugal pump <br />designed to produce a flow of approximately 90,000 gallons per minute (gpm) and driven at 1200 revolutions <br />per minute by a 13,200 volt motor [AB-MO]. The RCPs are shaft-sealed with a seal cartridge assembly [AB-<br />SEAL] that consists of three mechanical face-type sealing stages. The design flow rate for each seal staging <br />flow coil is 1.5 gpm at a differential pressure of 750 pounds per square inch (psi). Approximately 8 to 10 gpm <br />of seal injection water from the Makeup and Purification System [CB] is injected below the first stage <br />mechanical seal for lubricating and cooling the seals. Most of the injection water passes into the pump case <br />through the close-running, spiral grooved shaft and cover restriction bushing into the RCS, and the remainder <br />(1.5 gpm) flows upward through the three mechanical seals. Flow from the three pressure break-down <br />devices leaves the RCP through the seal return connection to return to the Makeup and Purification System. <br />Leakage across the third seal face passes up the shaft and into a standpipe that drains to the containment <br />normal sump. <br />Technical Specification(s): <br />Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.4.13 requires RCS operation leakage <br />be limited to no Pressure Boundary leakage, 1 gpm unidentified leakage, 10 gpm identified leakage, and 150 <br />gallons per day primary to secondary leakage through any one steam generator while the plant is in Modes 1 <br />through 4. With operational leakage not within these limits for reasons other than pressure boundary leakage <br />or primary to secondary leakage, TS LCO 3.4.13 Condition A requires the leakage to be reduced to within <br />limits within 4 hours. If Condition A cannot be met within the required completion time, or if Pressure <br />Boundary leakage exists, or primary to secondary leakage is not within limits, Condition B requires the plant <br />be placed in Mode 3 in 6 hours and in Mode 5 in 36 hours. <br />DESCRIPTION OF EVENT: <br />On March 26, 2016, the DBNPS shutdown for scheduled refueling and maintenance activities. On March 30, <br />2016, with the station in Mode 6 and the RCS depressurized, a scheduled engineering inspection identified <br />leakage from the RCP 1-1 seal injection flexible hose assembly and the leakage was determined to be an <br />unisolable leak from the reactor coolant pressure boundary. This leakage was characterized as one half teaspoon <br />of dry boric acid crystals, no active leak was identified and there was no indication of boric acid on the rest of the <br />RCP seal package. The seal cavity vent lines for the first, second, and third stage seals are opened during RCS <br />fill evolutions to vent non-condensable gases to the containment vent header. The leak was located on the RCP <br />1-1 first stage seal cavity vent line flexible hose assembly (at the flange to hose / bellows attachment), which is <br />classified as small bore American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Section III Class 2 piping (3/4 inch <br />pipe) between the RCP and the first isolation valve [AB-PSF] in the RCP vent piping. <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours. <br />Reported lessons learned are incorporated into the licensing process and fed back to industry. <br />Send comments regarding burden estimate to the FOIA, Privacy and Information Collections <br />Branch (T-5 F53), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, or <br />by internet e-mail to Infocollects.Resource@nrc.gov, and to the Desk Officer, Office of <br />Information and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB-10202, (3150-0104), Office of Management and <br />Budget Washington, DC 20503.

A similar through-wall weld solidification crack at the flange to hose / bellows tube pressure <br />boundary weld was likely the source for the boric acid leakage for the RCP 1-1 first stage seal cavity vent line. <br />Therefore, the direct cause of the RCP 1-1, first stage seal cavity vent line pressure boundary leakage was <br />likely a weld solidification crack during manufacture. Each of the other identified failure modes from operation, <br />installation, manufacture, and design were refuted. <br />The DBNPS had three (3) uninstalled spare flexible hose assemblies also supplied in the same batch as the <br />leaking hose for the RCP 1-1 first stage seal cavity vent line. These spare hose assemblies were <br />subsequently bubble tested (30 psig air pressure for 10 minutes) and helium tracer probe leak tested. All <br />three (3) uninstalled spare flexible hose assemblies passed the bubble test, but one (1) failed the helium tracer <br />probe leak test acceptance criteria. Helium tracer probe leak testing of the uninstalled spare hose assemblies <br />permits increased sensitivity for detection of extremely small leaks. Helium tracer probe leak testing was <br />proven an effective barrier that could have mitigated or prevented shipment of the flexible hose assembly with <br />pressure boundary leakage. Therefore, the root cause of the pressure boundary leak path (weld solidification <br />crack) not being detected during manufacture was less than adequate quality control inspection after <br />manufacture of the flexible hose assemblies such that an extremely small pressure boundary defect was not <br />detected by liquid penetrant and hydrostatic testing at 1.5 times design pressure (3750 psig) for 10 minutes. <br />ANALYSIS OF EVENT: <br />Because the RCP first stage seal cavity vent piping is classified, as ASME Section III Class 2 piping, in the <br />event of a postulated failure, per design the reactor can be shut down and cooled down in an orderly manner <br />assuming seal injection is maintained by the Makeup System. The estimated leak rate was well within the <br />capability of the Makeup System's capability. Therefore this event was of very low safety significance. <br />Reportability Discussion: <br />Based on existing precedence, this leak was determined to be reportable per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(A) as <br />degradation of a principal safety barrier; namely, the RCS, due to the material degradation (weld leak). The <br />NRC was verbally notified of this event at 0014 hours on March 31, 2016, via Event Number 51837. This <br />issue is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(A) as degradation of a principal safety <br />barrier. Additionally, as this is RCS Pressure Boundary leakage and it potentially could have existed with the <br />plant in operation, contrary to TS LCO 3.4.13, which does not allow any Pressure Boundary leakage, this <br />issue is also being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as operation or condition prohibited by <br />Technical Specifications. No safety functions were lost as a result of this issue and all TS required actions <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />	<br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />Page 4 of 4 <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours. <br />Reported lessons learned are incorporated into the licensing process and fed back to industry. <br />Send comments regarding burden estimate to the FOIA, Privacy and Information Collections <br />Branch (T-5 F53), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, or <br />by internet e-mail to Infocollects.Resource@nrc.gov, and to the Desk Officer, Office of <br />Information and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB-10202, (3150-0104), Office of Management and <br />Budget, Washington, DC 20503.

The flexible hose assembly manufacturer determined no 10 CFR 21 <br />reportable condition existed since there was no failure in the design, materials, inspection, or testing per code <br />requirements, and no evidence of a systemic (repeatable) issue. <br />CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: <br />Extent of condition walkdowns / engineering inspections were performed on the other eleven (11) installed <br />RCP seal cavity vent line flexible hose assemblies, and no other leaks were identified. There were no other ' <br />flexible hose assemblies identified in the nuclear piping system specification. <br />The RCP 1-1 first stage seal cavity vent line flexible hose assembly was replaced with one (1) of the spare <br />hose assemblies that passed the helium tracer probe test to resolve the reactor coolant pressure boundary <br />leakage and the operational mode restraint was closed on April 22, 2016. <br />The procurement requirements for the RCP seal cavity vent line flexible hose assemblies will be revised to add <br />a new required helium tracer probe leak test with acceptance criteria of at least 1 E-5 Standard cubic <br />centimeters/second, or other equivalent helium leak test method. Also, the procurement requirements will be <br />revised to reference to this event's Condition Report so that this preventive action will be retained. Additionally, <br />the flexible hose assemblies had the material status changed to Hold pending the change to the procurement <br />requirements to add that the helium tracer probe leak test be completed. <br />PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS: <br />Licensee Event Report (LER) 2012-002 and LER 2013-002 reported the discovery of a leaking elbow <br />socket weld in the RCP 1-2 first stage seal vent line resulting from high cycle fatigue. In response to LER <br />2013-002, the DBNPS RCPs first, second, and third stage seal cavity vent lines were replaced with flexible <br />hoses in April 2014 during the 18th Refueling Outage. There have been no similar LERs at the DBNPS <br />involving flexible hose defects in the past three years. <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015)<br /></span>
