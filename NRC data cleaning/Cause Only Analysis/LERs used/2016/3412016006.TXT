For an Ultimate Heat Sink (UHS) divisional reservoir to be operable, two Mechanical Draft Cooling Tower <br />(MDCT) fans in that division are required to be operable. The MDCT fans have a brake system to prevent fan overspeed during a <br />tornado. Fermi 2 procedures had directed personnel to declare the MDCT fans and UHS reservoir inoperable due to nonfunctionality of <br />the brake system only if a tornado watch or warning was in effect for the area near Fermi 2. The correct interpretation of TS 3.7.2 <br />would be to declare the MDCT fans and UHS reservoir inoperable any time the brake system was nonfunctional. Following discovery <br />of the inadequate interpretation of TS, a review of the brake system for the past three years was performed. The review identified 15 <br />occurrences where the brake system was nonfunctional and should have resulted in entry to TS 3.7.2. These 15 occurrences resulted in <br />operations or conditions prohibited by TS since TS Required Actions were not completed within their Completion Times. In addition, 5 <br />of the 15 were also instances where the plant configuration was such that it could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function <br />of structures or systems. Finally, 4 of the 15 were instances where the plant was in an unanalyzed condition. There were no <br />radiological releases associated with this event. There was no credible threat of a tornado during any of the 15 occurrences. The safety <br />significance was determined to be very low. The cause of the event was an incorrect proceduralized TS interpretation. Corrective <br />actions were taken to revise the procedure. <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016) <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />	<br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(06-2016) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />Np://www.nrc.govireading-rm/doc-collectionsinure_gs/staff/sr1022/r3/) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

TS 3.7.2 requires the Ultimate Heat <br />Sink (UHS) [[BS]] reservoir to be operable in Modes 1, 2 and 3. The UHS operability requirements in Modes 4 and 5 are <br />determined by the systems the UHS supports. The UHS reservoir is divided into two one-half capacity reservoirs, <br />corresponding to Division 1 and Division 2. Each reservoir is the cooling source for that division's service water <br />subsystems, including the service water for the Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs) [[DG]]. A two-cell MDCT is located <br />above each of the one-half capacity reservoirs. Each cell is equipped with a MDCT fan. Two MDCT fans above each <br />one-half capacity reservoir are required for it to be considered operable. The "A" and "C" MDCT fans are in Division 1 and <br />the "B" and "D" fans are in Division 2. The MDCT fans have a brake system to prevent overspeed from a design basis <br />tornado as described in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) Section 9.2.5.2.2. Thus the fan brakes are a <br />design feature of the fans and their functionality impacts the operability of the MDCT fans and therefore the UHS. <br />Contrary to this, a DTE procedure directed personnel to declare the MDCT fan and associated reservoir inoperable per TS <br />3.7.2 due to nonfunctionality of the brake system only if a tornado watch or tornado warning had been issued for the area <br />surrounding Fermi 2. This inadequate interpretation of TS was discovered during an NRC Component Design Basis <br />Inspection (CDBI). At the time of discovery on August 25, 2016, all of the MDCT fan brakes were functional and the <br />associated fans were operable. <br />The fan brake system for each of the four trains is actuated by nitrogen which is supplied by three nitrogen stages (bottles <br />[[GBM]]) arranged in series. The nitrogen source is the main bottle which supplies the other two bottles through pressure <br />reducing valves [M]. Each of the three nitrogen bottles is rated at a different pressure and has procedurally specified <br />lower and upper limits. The nitrogen pressures of all twelve bottles are recorded daily as part of operator rounds. If any of <br />the nitrogen bottles is outside of its specified limits, the fan brake system is considered nonfunctional. The main nitrogen <br />bottle for each train is replaced on an as-needed basis when it is out-of-specification or a trend indicates that it is <br />approaching its lower limit. The replacement of a nitrogen bottle is performed per plant procedures. <br />With a correct understanding of the applicable TS, a past operability review was performed for the three years prior to the <br />date of discovery. This review identified multiple occurrences where the MDCT fan brakes were nonfunctional. General <br />descriptions applicable to one or more of the occurrences are provided below and then followed by the details of the <br />specific occurrences. <br />For each occurrence, the associated MDCT fan and reservoir was considered operable at the time and no entry to TS <br />3.7.2 was made based on the fan brake nonfunctionality. Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.7.2 Condition B <br />Required Action B.1 requires restoration of the reservoir within 72 hours. LCO 3.7.2 Condition D Required Actions D.1 <br />and D.2 require the reactor to be in Mode 3 in 12 hours and Mode 4 in 36 hours if the Required Action and associated <br />Completion Time of Condition B are not met. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 	 2 	 of 	 11 <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(06-2016) <br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />httO/www.nrc.govireading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr 1 022/130 <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 <br />	<br />EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

In <br />the occurrences in Modes 1, 2 or 3, both EDGs in the division associated with the affected reservoir should have been <br />declared inoperable as a result of that division's reservoir being inoperable. LCO 3.8.1 Condition B for both EDGs in one <br />division inoperable should have been entered. LCO 3.8.1 Condition B Required Action B.1 requires that surveillance <br />requirement (SR) 3.8.1.1 be performed for operable offsite power circuit(s) within one hour and once per 8 hours <br />thereafter. SR 3.8.1.1 verifies correct breaker alignment and indicated power availability for each offsite circuit. Note that <br />although SR 3.8.1.1 was not performed at the required time, offsite power was available during every occurrence and <br />therefore the SR would have been met. LCO 3.8.1 Condition B Required Action B.2 states that required feature(s), <br />supported by the inoperable EDGs, must be declared inoperable within 4 hours when the redundant required feature(s) <br />are inoperable. LCO 3.8.1 Condition B Required Action B.4 requires restoration of one EDG in the division to operable <br />status within 72 hours, the same as the restoration time for the reservoir in LCO 3.7.2. LCO 3.8.1 Condition B also has a <br />24 hour Completion Time to either determine operable EDGs are not inoperable due to common cause failure (Required <br />Action B.3.1) or perform SR 3.8.1.2 for operable EDGs (Required Action B.3.2). In these occurrences, the EDGs were <br />inoperable due to the inoperability of the UHS rather than a common cause failure of the EDGs. This means that although <br />neither Required Action B.3.1 nor Required Action B.3.2 was performed at the time they were applicable, Required Action <br />B.3.1 would have been met in each case. Finally, LCO 3.8.1 Condition G requires the reactor to be in Mode 3 in 12 hours <br />if the Required Action and associated Completion Time of Condition B are not met. <br />In some of the occurrences, both divisions of the UHS were impacted at the same time or work on EDGs was being <br />performed in one division while the opposite division of the UHS was impacted by the fan brake nonfunctionality. This <br />subset of occurrences would require entry to LCO 3.8.1 Condition C for one or both EDGs in both divisions inoperable. <br />LCO Condition C Required Action C.1 requires that both EDGs in one division be restored to operable status within 2 <br />hours. In addition, LCO 3.8.1 Condition G requires the reactor to be in Mode 3 in 12 hours if the Required Action and <br />associated Completion Time of Condition C are not met. <br />Some of the occurrences were while the plant was in Modes 4 or 5. As described above, UHS operability requirements in <br />Modes 4 and 5 are determined by the systems the UHS supports. Although the note in LCO 3.7.2 refers to LCO 3.8.1 for <br />EDGs made inoperable by UHS, LCO 3.8.2 is the applicable LCO for EDGs in Modes 4 and 5. LCO 3.8.2 requires two <br />EDGs to be capable of supplying one division of alternating current (AC) power. LCO 3.8.2 Condition B for one or both <br />required EDGs inoperable has the following Required Actions: B.1 to suspend core alterations, B.2 to suspend movement <br />of recently irradiated fuel assemblies in secondary containment, B.3 to initiate action to suspend operations with the <br />potential to drain the reactor vessel, and B.4 to initiate action to restore required EDGs to operable status. All four of <br />these Required Actions have a Completion Time of "Immediately." <br />The occurrences are as follows: <br />1) On October 30, 2013, the main nitrogen bottle for the "B" MDCT fan brake was identified as in its required range, but <br />nearing its lower limit. A work order was generated to replace the bottle before it exceeded its limit. At no time was the <br />bottle found out-of-specification other than during this pre-planned maintenance. From 1447 EDT on October 31 to 0214 <br />EDT on November 1 (i.e. approximately 11.5 hours), while operating in Mode 1 between 95% and 100% power, the "B" <br />MDCT fan brake was nonfunctional due to the replacement of the nitrogen bottle. During this time period, the "B" MDCT <br />fan was inoperable and therefore the Division 2 UHS reservoir was inoperable as well. No entry to TS LCO 3.7.2 or 3.8.1 <br />was made related to this. Thus, TS LCO 3.8.1 Required Actions B.1 and B.2 were not completed within their Completion <br />Times and this is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation or condition prohibited by TS. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page <br />	 3 	 of 	 11 <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(06-2016) <br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />httv//www nrc.govireading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/srl 022/r31) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

LER NUMBER <br />Fermi 2 341 <br /> 	 YEAR SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />REV <br />NO. <br />2016 006 00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />2) At 0901 EST on January 24, 2014, while operating in Mode 1 at 85% power, the main nitrogen bottle for the "A" MDCT <br />fan brake was found out-of-specification low. Subsequently, one of the other nitrogen bottles for the "A" MDCT fan brake <br />was also found out-of-specification low. A work order was generated to replace the main nitrogen bottle. From 0901 EST <br />on January 24 until the bottle replacement was completed at 1537 EST on January 31 (i.e. approximately 7 days), the "A" <br />MDCT fan brake was nonfunctional due to the nitrogen bottle being out-of-specification and then being replaced. During <br />this time period, the "A" MDCT fan was inoperable and therefore the Division 1 UHS reservoir was inoperable as well. No <br />entry to TS LCO 3.7.2 or 3.8.1 was made related to this. Thus, TS LCO 3.8.1 Required Actions B.1, B.2, B.3.1 (or B.3.2), <br />B.4, and G and TS LCO 3.7.2 Required Actions B.1, D.1, and D.2 were not completed within their Completion Times and <br />this is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation or condition prohibited by TS. In addition, the "A" MDCT <br />fan brake nonfunctionality coincided with approximately 46 hours where various Division 2 safety-related systems, <br />structures, or components (SSCs), including Division 2 EDGs, were inoperable. Since both EDGs in one division are <br />required to provide AC power, LCO 3.8.1 Condition C should have been entered. The Division 2 EDGs were not always <br />restored to operable status within the allowable Completion Time of LCO 3.8.1 Condition C Required Action C.1. Other <br />Division 2 SSCs inoperable during this time included Residual Heat Removal (RHR) [[BO]] and Standby Gas Treatment <br />System (SGTS) [[BH]] which, when considering the "A" MDCT fan brake nonfunctionality, resulted in exceeding the <br />Completion Times for Required Actions in LCO 3.5.1 Condition K (for RHR) and LCO 3.6.4.3 Condition D (for SGTS). <br />These missed Completion Times are also reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). The period of overlap described <br />above also resulted in an unanalyzed condition because the plant configuration when equipment in Division 2, such as <br />EDGs, was inoperable while the Division 1 UHS and EDGs were inoperable would not support safe shutdown capability in <br />the event of a tornado. This is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B) as an event or condition that results in the plant <br />being in an unanalyzed condition that significantly degraded plant safety. It was previously reported to the NRC under 10 <br />CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B) on August 31, 2016 (Event Notification 52214). Note that the start time of this occurrence (0901 <br />EST) and the amount of time overlap with Division 2 SSCs inoperable (46 hours) indicated above are both slightly different <br />than the times indicated in Event Notification 52214 (0915 EST and approximately 30 hours) due to the subsequent review <br />of data, but there is no impact on applicable reporting criteria due to these differences. The times when both RHR <br />divisions were inoperable or one or more EDGs in both divisions were inoperable is also reportable under 10 CFR <br />50.73(a)(2)(v)(B) and (D) as an event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of <br />structures or systems that are needed to remove residual heat and mitigate the consequences of an accident, <br />respectively. The times when both SGTS subsystems were inoperable is also reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C) <br />as an event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are <br />needed to control the release of radioactive material. These losses of safety function were not reported as an 8-hour <br />Event Notification under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v)(B), (C), or (D) since the described condition no longer existed at the time <br />of discovery in August 2016. <br />3) On February 12, 2014, the main nitrogen bottle for the "B" MDCT fan brake was identified as in its required range, but <br />nearing its lower limit. A work order was generated to replace the "B" bottle before it exceeded its limit. Prior to the <br />performance of this work order, at 1152 EST on February 14, 2014, while in Mode 5 at 0% power and at a reactor <br />pressure vessel temperature of approximately 95 degrees Fahrenheit (F), the nitrogen bottles for the "A" MDCT fan brake <br />were found out-of-specification low. A work order was generated to replace the "A" main nitrogen bottle. From 1152 EST <br />on February 14 until the bottle replacement was completed at 1514 EST on February 24 (i.e. approximately 10 days), the <br />"A" MDCT fan brake was nonfunctional due to its nitrogen bottle being out-of-specification and then being replaced. From <br />1118 EST to 1529 EST on February 20 (i.e. approximately 4 hours), the "B" MDCT fan brake was nonfunctional due to the <br />replacement of its nitrogen bottle. At no time was the "B" bottle found out-of-specification other than during this pre-<br />planned maintenance. All of this occurred during a refueling outage which had begun on February 10 and continued into <br />March (i.e. beyond the time when the "A" and "B" MDCT fan brakes were functional again). During the 10 day time period <br />discussed above, the "A" MDCT fan was inoperable and therefore the Division 1 UHS reservoir was inoperable as well. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page <br />	 4 	 of 	 11 <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(06-2016) <br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />hIp://www.nrc.govireading-rm/doc-collections/nurecis/staff/srl 022/r31) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

No entry to TS LCO <br />3.7.2 was made related to this and TS LCO 3.7.2 Required Actions B.1, D.1, and D.2 were not completed within their <br />Completion Times. In Mode 5 (i.e. the refueling outage), TS LCO 3.8.2 only requires a single division of EDGs to be <br />operable. During the time period when only the "A" MDCT fan was inoperable due to the nonfunctionality of its brake, the <br />Division 2 UHS reservoir and EDGs were the ones credited to be operable at that time. This configuration was acceptable <br />per the TS. However, during the 4 hour time period when the Division 2 UHS and EDGs were made inoperable by the "B" <br />MDCT fan brake nonfunctionality, entry to TS LCO 3.8.2 Condition B would have been required. Required Actions B.1 <br />through B.4 were not performed within their Completion Times. The failure to complete Required Actions within their <br />Completion Times is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation or condition prohibited by TS. The <br />coincident nonfunctionality of the "A" and "B" MDCT fan brakes, in addition to any other SSCs out-of-service during the <br />refueling outage, resulted in an unanalyzed condition because the plant configuration when both divisions of UHS and <br />EDGs were inoperable would not support safe shutdown capability in the event of a tornado. This is reportable under 10 <br />CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B) as an event or condition that results in the plant being in an unanalyzed condition that significantly <br />degraded plant safety. It was previously reported to the NRC under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B) on August 31, 2016 (Event <br />Notification 52214). Note that the start time of this occurrence indicated above (1152 EST) is slightly earlier than the time <br />indicated in Event Notification 52214 (1747 EST) due to the subsequent review of data, but there is no impact on <br />applicable reporting criteria due to this difference. The times when both divisions of UHS were inoperable or one or more <br />EDGs in both divisions were inoperable is also reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(B) and (D) as an event or <br />condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to <br />remove residual heat and mitigate the consequences of an accident, respectively. This was not reported as an 8-hour <br />Event Notification under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v)(B) or (D) since the described condition no longer existed at the time of <br />discovery in August 2016. <br />4) On August 6, 2014, the main nitrogen bottle for the "B" MDCT fan brake was identified as in its required range, but <br />nearing its lower limit. A work order was generated to replace the bottle before it exceeded its limit. At no time was the <br />bottle found out-of-specification other than during this pre-planned maintenance. From 0800 EDT to 1435 EDT on August <br />8 (i.e. approximately 6.5 hours), while operating in Mode 1 at 100% power, the "B" MDCT fan brake was nonfunctional due <br />to the replacement of the nitrogen bottle. During this time period, the "B" MDCT fan was inoperable and therefore the <br />Division 2 UHS reservoir was inoperable as well. No entry to TS LCO 3.7.2 or 3.8.1 was made related to this. Thus, TS <br />LCO 3.8.1 Required Actions B.1 and B.2 were not completed within their Completion Times and this is reportable under <br />10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation or condition prohibited by TS. <br />5) At 1432 EST on December 11, 2014, while operating in Mode 1 at 58% power, the main nitrogen bottle for the "A" <br />MDCT fan brake was found out-of-specification low. A work order was generated to replace the bottle. From 1432 EST <br />on December 11 until the bottle replacement was completed at 1319 EST on December 18 (i.e. approximately 7 days), the <br />"A" MDCT fan brake was nonfunctional due to the nitrogen bottle being out-of-specification and then being replaced. <br />During this time period, the "A" MDCT fan was inoperable and therefore the Division 1 UHS reservoir was inoperable as <br />well. No entry to TS LCO 3.7.2 or 3.8.1 was made related to this. Thus, TS LCO 3.8.1 Required Actions B.1, B.2, B.3.1 <br />(or B.3.2), B.4, and G and TS LCO 3.7.2 Required Actions B.1, D.1, and D.2 were not completed within their Completion <br />Times and this is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation or condition prohibited by TS. <br />6) At 1106 EST on January 6, 2015, while operating in Mode 1 at 100% power, the main nitrogen bottle for the "B" MDCT <br />fan brake was found out-of-specification low. A work order was generated to replace the bottle. From 1106 EST on <br />January 6 until the bottle replacement was completed at 1441 EST on January 9 (i.e. approximately 76 hours), the "B" <br />MDCT fan brake was nonfunctional due to the nitrogen bottle being out-of-specification and then being replaced.

No <br />entry to TS LCO 3.7.2 or 3.8.1 was made related to this. Thus, TS LCO 3.8.1 Required Actions B.1, B.2, B.3.1 (or B.3.2), <br />and B.4 and TS LCO 3.7.2 Required Action B.1 were not completed within their Completion Times and this is reportable <br />under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation or condition prohibited by TS. Since the bottle replacement was required <br />after the bottle was already out-of-specification, this was not considered pre-planned maintenance. The Division 2 UHS <br />reservoir is the heat sink for the Division 2 Emergency Equipment Service Water (EESW) / Emergency Equipment Cooling <br />Water (EECW) [[CC]] subsystems. Division 2 EESW/EECW is necessary to support the operability of the High Pressure <br />Coolant Injection (HPCI) [[BJ]] system, which is a single train system. During the approximately 76 hour time-frame <br />discussed above, the inoperability of the UHS could have prevented the HPCI system from fulfilling its safety function to <br />mitigate the consequences of an accident. Therefore, this occurrence is also reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) <br />as an event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are <br />needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. This was not reported as an 8-hour Event Notification under 10 CFR <br />50.72(b)(3)(v)(D) since the described condition no longer existed at the time of discovery in August 2016. <br />7) At 0852 EST on January 23, 2015, while operating in Mode 1 at 100% power, the main nitrogen bottle for the "A" MDCT <br />fan brake was found out-of-specification low. A work order was generated to replace the bottle. From 0852 EST until the <br />bottle replacement was completed at 1632 EST on January 23 (i.e. approximately 7.5 hours), the "A" MDCT fan brake was <br />nonfunctional due to the nitrogen bottle being out-of-specification and then being replaced. During this time period, the "A" <br />MDCT fan was inoperable and therefore the Division 1 UHS reservoir was inoperable as well. No entry to TS LCO 3.7.2 <br />or 3.8.1 was made related to this. Thus, TS LCO 3.8.1 Required Actions B.1 and B.2 were not completed within their <br />Completion Times and this is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation or condition prohibited by TS. <br />8) At 1000 EDT on March 23, 2015, while in Mode 4 at 0% power and at a reactor pressure vessel temperature of <br />approximately 100 degrees F, the main nitrogen bottle for the "A" MDCT fan brake was found out-of-specification low. <br />Subsequently, the other nitrogen bottles for the "A" MDCT fan brake were also found out-of-specification low. A work <br />order was generated to replace the main nitrogen bottle. From 1000 EDT on March 23 until the bottle replacement was <br />completed at 1447 EDT on April 9 (i.e. approximately 17 days), the "A" MDCT fan brake was nonfunctional due to the <br />nitrogen bottle being out-of-specification and then being replaced. This occurred during a forced outage which had begun <br />on March 21 and was completed on April 3 when Mode 4 was exited. By the time the "A" MDCT fan brake was functional <br />again, the plant had returned to Mode 1 at 100% power. During the 17 day time period, the "A" MDCT fan was inoperable <br />and therefore the Division 1 UHS reservoir was inoperable as well. No entry to TS LCO 3.7.2 was made related to this <br />and TS LCO 3.7.2 Required Actions B.1, D.1, and D.2 were not completed within their Completion Times. In Mode 4 (i.e. <br />the forced outage), TS LCO 3.8.2 only requires a single division of EDGs to be operable. Until March 27, the Division 2 <br />UHS and EDGs were the ones credited to be operable. This configuration was acceptable per the TS. However starting <br />on March 27 at 2320 EDT, the Division 1 UHS reservoir and EDGs were the ones credited to be operable at that time. <br />Since the Division 1 UHS and EDGs were made inoperable by the "A" MDCT fan brake nonfunctionality, entry to TS LCO <br />3.8.2 Condition B would have been required. Required Actions B.1 through B.3 were not applicable in Mode 4; however, <br />Required Action B.4 was not performed within its Completion Time. Mode 4 was exited on April 3 with the Division 1 UHS <br />and EDGs still inoperable due to the "A" MDCT fan brake nonfunctionality; this represented an unauthorized mode change <br />per TS SR 3.0.4. After exiting Mode 4, the requirement for all EDGs to be operable per TS LCO 3.8.1 would have <br />resumed. Although the Division 1 EDGs were still inoperable, no entry to TS LCO 3.8.1 was made related to this. Thus, <br />TS LCO 3.8.1 Required Actions B.1, B.2, B.3.1 (or B.3.2), B.4, and G were not completed within their Completion Times. <br />The failure to complete Required Actions within their Completion Times and the unauthorized mode change are reportable <br />under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation or condition prohibited by TS. In addition, the "A" MDCT fan brake <br />nonfunctionality coincided with approximately 29 hours during the forced outage and ensuing startup where various <br />Division 2 SSCs, including Division 2 EDGs and EESW/EECW, were inoperable.

Thus, TS <br />LCO 3.8.1 Required Action B.1 was not completed within its Completion Time and this is reportable under 10 CFR <br />50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation or condition prohibited by TS. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 	 8 	 of 	 11 <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(06-2016) <br />- <br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.govireadir-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1022/r3/)  <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

LER NUMBER <br />Fermi 2 341 <br />YEAR SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />REV <br />NO. <br />2016 006 00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />SIGNIFICANT SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS <br />As described previously, the MDCT fan brakes are only required for a design basis tornado; they are not required for other <br />design basis events. No tornado watches or warnings occurred during the time-frames above when MDCT fan brakes <br />were nonfunctional. Since there was no credible threat of a tornado during any of the periods when the MDCT fan brakes <br />were nonfunctional, the MDCT fans and associated UHS would have been able to perform their intended functions. Also <br />note that 8 out of 15 of the occurrences discussed in this LER occurred during the months of December, January, and <br />February. Historical weather data from more than 50 years shows that tornadoes are extremely rare in Michigan during <br />those particular months. <br />A bounding risk evaluation was performed to assess the on-line Probabilistic Safety Assessment (PSA) risk impact of the <br />MDCT fan brakes being unable to perform their function in the event of a tornado strike to the Fermi 2 RHR complex (i.e. <br />where the MDCTs are located). Using the limiting configuration of both Division 2 MDCT cells (i.e. the "B" and "D" fans) <br />unavailable for an entire year yields increases in core damage frequency (CDF) and large early release frequencies <br />(LERF) of 2.38E-07 per year and 7.20E-08 per year, respectively. Changes in CDF below 1.0E-06 per year and changes <br />in LERF below 1.0E-07 per year are considered to be of very low safety significance. <br />Although the TS Bases indicate that both MDCT fans are required for that UHS division to be operable, it should also be <br />noted that the PSA success criteria require that only one MDCT cell be available in a division for that division to remove <br />decay heat; this limits the risk impact of a single MDCT fan brake in a division being unavailable. Of the 15 occurrences <br />described above, 13 involve impact to only one MDCT cell (i.e. only a single MDCT fan brake is nonfunctional) in a <br />division at a time. While these occurrences do represent conditions prohibited by TS, they still met the PSA success <br />criteria. <br />During shutdown conditions (Modes 4 and 5), the site shutdown risk procedure would have, on two occasions, evaluated <br />the outage risk color as red (one time for both divisions of UHS inoperable (i.e. number 3) and one time for one division of <br />UHS inoperable with inoperable EDGs in the other division (i.e. number 8)). In neither case, however, were both MDCT <br />fan brakes within a division nonfunctional, meaning the UHS was available for decay heat removal in the event of a <br />tornado strike to the RHR complex; the risk of this configuration is qualitatively deemed to be low. <br />As discussed above for the occurrence from January 6 to 9, 2015 (i.e. number 6), the nonfunctionality of the "B" MDCT fan <br />brake could have prevented the HPCI system from fulfilling its safety function. However, the Reactor Core Isolation <br />Cooling (RCIC) [[BN]] system remained available for high pressure injection in the event of an emergency. The Standby <br />Feedwater [[SJ]] system was also available for high pressure injection, except for a 1.5 hour period on January 9 during a <br />surveillance test. Additionally, the Automatic Depressurization System [[JE]] was available to reduce reactor pressure to <br />within the capabilities of the low pressure Emergency Core Cooling Systems. The longest instance where HPCI could <br />have been prevented from fulfilling its safety function as a result of the MDCT fan brake nonfunctionality was <br />approximately 76 hours. TS 3.5.1 allows HPCI to be taken out of service for planned outages for up to 14 days. The risk <br />increase associated with the impact to HPCI is bounded by the PSA evaluation for Division 2 discussed above. It is also <br />important to note that, although HPCI was considered inoperable due to the propagation of TS requirements for UHS and <br />was therefore considered a loss of safety function in this LER, HPCI is not a system required for safe shutdown in the <br />event of a tornado per UFSAR Table 3.3-2. HPCI is required for design basis accidents such as a loss of coolant accident <br />(LOCA). <br />As discussed above for the occurrence from January 24 to 31, 2014 (i.e. number 2), the nonfunctionality of the "A" MDCT <br />fan brake combined with work on the Division 2 SGTS could have prevented the SGTS from fulfilling its safety function. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page <br />	 9 	 of 	 11 <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />	<br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(06-2016) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.govireading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1022/r3/)  <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 <br />	<br />EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

LER NUMBER  <br />Fermi 2 341 <br />YEAR SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />REV <br />NO. <br />2016 006 00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />However, the Reactor Building Heating Venti ation and Air Conditioning (RBHVAC) [[VA]] system remained available <br />during that time to maintain the Secondary Containment (SC) [[NH]] pressure boundary. It is also important to note that, <br />although SGTS was considered inoperable due to the propagation of TS requirements for UHS and was therefore <br />considered a loss of safety function in this LER, SGTS is not a system required for safe shutdown in the event of a <br />tornado per UFSAR Table 3.3-2. SGTS is required for design basis accidents such as a LOCA. <br />Offsite power was available during all fifteen of the occurrences. Combustion Turbine Generator (CTG) [[GEN]] 11-1 <br />serves as an alternate AC power source for Fermi 2 during station blackout conditions. CTG 11-1 was operable during all <br />of these occurrences with the exception of a three day period from March 25 to 28, 2015 that overlapped with the <br />occurrence from March 23 to April 9, 2015 (i.e. number 8). The continued availability of offsite power plus the availability <br />of CTG 11-1, with the one exception noted, reduces the consequence of the potential loss of safety function of the EDGs. <br />There were no radiological releases associated with any of the occurrences discussed in this event. <br />CAUSE OF THE EVENT <br />The cause of the event was an incorrect proceduralized TS interpretation. Fermi 2 utilizes an Operations Department <br />Expectation (ODE) to provide guidance for implementing LCOs. ODE-12, Revision 36, "LCOs," contained specific <br />guidance on how to treat nonfunctionality of the MDCT fan brakes. This guidance incorrectly directed Operations <br />personnel to declare the MDCT fan inoperable only if a tornado watch or warning was issued for the area surrounding <br />Fermi 2. This guidance was based on a letter dated December 28, 1989 in which DTE notified the NRC of the intent to <br />determine MDCT fan operability in this manner. DTE had assumed that this position was acceptable to the NRC and <br />therefore had implemented this position in the ODE. However, based on a discussion and review during the August 2016 <br />CDBI, it was determined that the NRC had never approved this position and that the position was incorrect. <br />The individual occurrences of MDCT fan brake nonfunctionality discussed above were all related to the brake system <br />nitrogen bottles. There are several causes for the nitrogen bottle pressures to be nearing their limits or out-of-<br />specification. The nitrogen bottles may slowly lose pressure over time due to imperfect leak-tightness of the system or <br />may decrease more rapidly if there is a more significant leak. In addition, the pressure in the bottles may be impacted by <br />the ambient temperature due to weather changes (i.e. winter to summer and vice-versa) or operating equipment nearby, <br />such as surveillance testing of the MDCT fans. <br />CORRECTIVE ACTIONS <br />As described above, the inadequate interpretation of TS was embedded in the procedure ODE-12. Corrective action has <br />been taken to revise ODE-12 (Revision 37 dated August 27, 2016) such that it now states that "If the MDCT fan brake(s) <br />are not meeting their ability to function for any reason including nitrogen pressures, the associated MDCT fan will be <br />declared INOPERABLE and actions taken in accordance per TS 3.7.2." The revised ODE has already been used since <br />that time to prompt the appropriate entry into the Technical Specifications following detection of a nitrogen bottle out-of-<br />specification for the MDCT "C" fan brake on August 29, 2016. <br />The corrective actions associated with the individual occurrences were discussed as part of the description of the <br />occurrence. In all cases, the main nitrogen bottle was replaced to restore the pressure to within the required limits. <br />In addition, DTE will evaluate potential modifications to the nitrogen bottle configuration to reduce the frequency of <br />nitrogen bottle replacement and/or reduce the time required to replace a nitrogen bottle. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 	 10 	 of 	 11 <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(06-2016) <br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http_://www.nrcsgovireading-rm/doc-collections/nuregsistaff/srl 022/r31) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

Two other LERs regarding the operability of the MDCT fan brake <br />system were identified. LER 99-008-00 documented a condition prohibited by TS for a MDCT fan brake being inoperable <br />due to valve misalignment. The corrective actions associated with LER 99-008-00 addressed the valve alignment <br />problems and did not address the question of how the operability of the MDCT fans is treated when the fan brake nitrogen <br />pressures are outside of specification. LER 89-016-01 documented a deficiency in the design of the power supply of the <br />MDCT fan brake system that could have led to the system being inoperable. The corrective actions associated with LER <br />89-016-01 included upgrades to the MDCT fan brake system and an engineering review which confirmed the necessity of <br />the fan brakes during a design basis tornado. However, a review of LER 89-016-01 also resulted in the formulation of the <br />DTE position that the fan brakes only needed to be operable when tornado conditions are present (i.e. watch or warning) <br />which was communicated to the NRC by letter dated December 28, 1989. That DTE position taken in 1989 was the basis <br />for the incorrect procedural guidance that caused the inadequate interpretation of TS as discussed in this LER. Therefore, <br />these previous occurrences would not have prevented the condition described in this LER. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 	 11 	 of 	 11<br /></span>
