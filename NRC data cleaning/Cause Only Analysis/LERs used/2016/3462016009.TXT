Following the Reactor trip, <br />the Steam Feedwater Rupture Control System (SFRCS) actuated due to high Steam Generator 1 level and initiated the <br />Auxiliary Feedwater System. The most probable cause of the SFRCS actuation was a failed operational amplifier in the <br />Integrated Control System (ICS), causing the ICS to not reduce Feedwater flow to Steam Generator 1 following the <br />Reactor trip. 	 , <br />Completed corrective actions include closing the roof vents, sealing the top of the AVR cabinet, improved configuration <br />control of the vents, and replacement of the failed ICS module. Scheduled corrective actions include presenting a case <br />study to improve recognition of elevated risk issues, and review of the ICS by a multi-functional team to address system <br />performance concerns. <br />This event is being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as an event that resulted in automatic actuation of the <br />Reactor Protection System, and an automatic actuation of the Auxiliary Feedwater System. <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016) <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />	<br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />'•.••• - <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.qov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nureqs/staff/srl 022/r3/ <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LER NUMBER <br />Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station Unit 1 <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />- 009 <br />05000 - 	 346 YEAR <br />2016 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />- 00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX]. <br />System Description: <br />The Main Generator [TB] converts rotating mechanical energy of the Main Turbine [TA] into electrical energy. <br />The excitation system provides regulated Direct Current (DC) power to the Main Generator field/rotor for <br />controlling the voltage and reactive volt-ampere output, with an Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) <br />controlling the electrical current to the Main Generator field. The AVR was installed at the Davis-Besse <br />Nuclear Power Station (DBNPS) in 2014 as a digital upgrade from the previous analog voltage regulator. <br />The Integrated Control System (ICS) [JA] provides for coordination of the Reactor, Steam Generator <br />Feedwater control, and Main Turbine under all operating conditions. This coordination consists of producing <br />the best load response to the unit load demand while recognizing the capabilities and limitations of the <br />controlled equipment. When any single portion of the station is at an operating limit or a control section is on <br />manual, the ICS uses the limited or manual section as a load reference. One of the features of the ICS <br />Feedwater Subsystem is a Rapid Feedwater Reduction (RFR) scheme, which is designed to prevent <br />refeeding the Steam Generators with Feedwater when not warranted to prevent a primary system (Reactor <br />Coolant System) overcooling transient. The RFR circuitry provides for a rapid decrease in Feedwater flow <br />rate after a Reactor trip and is also designed to preclude low Steam Generator level actuations of the Steam <br />and Feedwater Rupture Control System (SFRCS) resulting from undershoot of the low level control limits. <br />After a Reactor trip, with all Feedwater stations in automatic, an RFR demand signal equivalent to <br />approximately four (4) percent of total Feedwater flow is substituted for Feedwater Control valve position. <br />The SFRCS [JB] is required to ensure an adequate Feedwater supply to remove Reactor decay heat during <br />periods when the normal Feedwater supply has been lost. The SFRCS is designed to automatically start the <br />Auxiliary Feedwater System (AFW) [BA] in the event of a Main Steam line break, Main Feedwater line <br />rupture, a low level in the Steam Generators [AB-SG] or a loss of all four Reactor Coolant Pumps. The <br />SFRCS is designed to automatically isolate the Main Steam System (MS) [SB] and the Main Feedwater <br />System (MFW) [SJ] in the event of a Main Steam line break or Main Feedwater line rupture. The AFW is <br />automatically aligned to feed the unaffected Steam Generator upon a loss of steam pressure in one of the <br />Steam Generators. Although not a safety function, the SFRCS also isolates MFW to the Steam Generators <br />and initiates AFW to their respective Steam Generators in the event of high Steam Generator level. This is to <br />prevent a Steam Generator overfill condition and subsequent spill over into the Main Steam lines and Main <br />Turbine; which could cause thermal shock of Steam Generator internal structures, and could challenge the <br />integrity of steam line piping and supports caused by excessive Main Feedwater addition. This high Steam <br />Generator level trip isolates the Main Steam Isolation Valves (MSIVs) [SB-ISV] to prevent damage to <br />downstream plant equipment. <br />DESCRIPTION OF EVENT: <br />On September 9, 2016, the DBNPS was operating in Mode 1 at approximately 100 percent power. Rain had <br />been forecasted in the evening, and operators were dispatched to close the Turbine Building [NM] roof vents, <br />which were routinely opened to help limit ambient temperatures within the building. Four of the 14 roof vents <br />could not be closed due to known and documented material deficiencies. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 2 of 6 <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(11-2015) <br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />htto://www.nrc.00v/readinci-rm/doc-collections/nureds/staff/sr1022/r3/ <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150.0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

Rain fell through the four open <br />roof vents and onto the Main Turbine operating deck. At 0336 hours on September 10, 2016, an electrical <br />ground alarm was received on Direct Current (DC) Bus 2 [EJ-BU], but no other plant impact immediately <br />occurred. On the Northwest side of the Turbine deck, the water pooled on the floor beneath an open roof <br />vent and spread across the floor. The water then ran down a vibration joint between the Turbine-Generator <br />pedestal and the Turbine deck floor, falling onto the top of the Main Generator AVR cabinet. The rain water <br />then migrated inside the AVR cabinet through conduit connections on the top of the cabinet. At 0343 hours, <br />with the unit at approximately 100 percent power, a lockout of the Main Generator occurred due to a loss of <br />field. The generator lockout tripped the Main Turbine, which satisfied the Anticipatory Reactor Trip System <br />logic, resulting in a trip of the Reactor Protection System (RPS). Initial unit response to the Reactor trip was <br />as designed, and all control rods fully inserted. <br />Following the reactor trip, the control room operators observed Steam Generator 1 level rising due to a failure <br />of the ICS to properly respond to the Reactor trip. Feedwater Loop 2 responded correctly to the reactor trip <br />and controlled level in Steam Generator 2 at approximately 40 inches. The operators took manual control of <br />the Main Feedwater Control valves and attempted to reduce Main Feedwater flow. However, the SFRCS <br />actuated on high Steam Generator 1 level as level reached the 220 inch setpoint approximately one minute <br />after the reactor trip. All SFRCS components responded as designed, with both AFW Pump Turbines <br />starting, both MSIVs closing, and isolation of the Main Feedwater System. <br />CAUSE OF EVENT: <br />The direct cause of the generator lockout and subsequent reactor trip was rain falling through an open roof <br />vent onto the Turbine deck, which migrated into the AVR through one or more of the cabinet's conduit <br />connections. <br />The root causes of the generator lockout and reactor trip were (1) Operations Shift Managers did not <br />advocate adequate and timely compensatory actions to eliminate the risk to generation posed by rain falling <br />onto energized equipment through a stuck open Turbine Building roof vent, and (2) station management <br />failed to recognize the roof vent rain issue as a potential imminent risk to generation. There are fourteen <br />4-foot by 8-foot smoke and heat vents in the Turbine Building roof, which are designed to automatically open <br />at 165 degrees F due to a fusible link. Manual pull release handles also allow each vent to be opened without <br />disturbing the fusible link. The roof vents had been routinely opened during warm weather to compensate for <br />deficiencies in-the Turbine Building ventilation in order to reduce Turbine Building ambient temperatures. On <br />August 14, 2016, it was identified that four of the roof vents could not be closed, including roof vent number 8 <br />above the AVR. On the evening of August 17, 2016, operators noted water running from the Turbine deck <br />(623 foot elevation) to the floor below (603 foot elevation) following a heavy rain storm due to roof vent 8. <br /> <br />being open. Maintenance personnel inspected the roof vents the following day to identify the necessary <br />repairs, but no accelerated actions were taken beyond the normal work management process to repair the <br />vents. Catch basins were installed below roof vent 8 on August 27, 2016, in attempt to collect the rain water <br />to prevent it from affecting the equipment below. <br />1.

LER NUMBER <br />Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station Unit 1 <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />- 009 <br />05000 - 	 346 YEAR <br />2016 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />- 00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />CAUSE OF EVENT: (continued) <br />The direct cause of the high Steam Generator 1 level and resultant SFRCS actuation was a faulty output of <br />ICS Module 5-6-6 which did not position the Main and Startup Feedwater Control Valves to the target <br />positions as required, resulting in overfeeding of Steam Generator 1. The most probable cause of the module <br />faulty output was degradation of an operational amplifier on the module. <br />The root cause of the high Steam Generator 1 level was that corrective actions taken to address the <br />vulnerabilities in the ICS were not adequate to prevent future events. Contributing causes identified were 1) <br />that the ICS including the RFR circuit are not safety related and in general are not fault tolerant, so a single <br />failure can prevent the system from functioning as desired, and 2) that modifications to upgrade the ICS to <br />make the system fault tolerant and corrective actions to develop RFR circuit testing were not performed. <br />Actions had been taken to mitigate the potential for ICS/RFR problems by creating/implementing preventive <br />maintenance (PM) activities to periodically calibrate and refurbish ICS modules associated with RFR in <br />accordance with industry standard practices. These actions did not eliminate the system vulnerabilities, <br />however, they served to reduce the likelihood or frequency of occurrences. <br />ANALYSIS OF EVENT: <br />All control rods inserted fully as designed. Following the Reactor trip, the SFRCS actuated due to high SG 1 <br />level. All SFRCS components responded as designed, with both AFW Pump Turbines starting, both MSIVs <br />closing, and isolating the MFW System. <br />To determine the risk significance of the initiating event (Reactor trip due to rain water intrusion), the currently <br />effective Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) Model was used with an initiating event of a Reactor/Turbine <br />trip always occurring along with a loss of Main Feedwater as experienced and described below. Based on <br />this, an Incremental Conditional Core Damage Probability of 4.14E-7 and an Incremental Conditional Large <br />Early Release Probability of 9.59E-9 were calculated for the initiating event. Normalizing these values results <br />in an estimated delta Core Damage Frequency of 4.14E-7 per year, and a delta Large Early Release <br />Frequency of 9.59E-9 per year for the Reactor trip due to rain water intrusion, which are both considered to <br />be of very low safety significance. <br />ICS Module 5-6-6, which was determined to be the cause of the improper control of Steam Generator 1 level <br />following the Reactor trip, had been successfully calibrated during the previous refueling outage ending May <br />9, 2016. Utilizing a maximum exposure time of approximately 0.34 years in the PRA Model results in an <br />estimated delta Core Damage Frequency of 2.0E-7/year and a delta Large Early Release Frequency of <br />6E-9/year, which are also both considered to be of very low safety significance. Because the delta Core <br />Damage Frequency for this event was determined to be greater than 1E-7 per year, the impact on external <br />events was evaluated. Evaluation of the DBNPS Individual Plant Examination of External Events (IPEEE) <br />Fire PRA model yields a delta Core Damage Frequency of 6.60E-7 per year, which is considered to be of <br />very low safety significance. This condition causes no increase in Seismic risk, so it also is considered to be <br />of very low safety significance. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) <br />	 Page 4 of 6 <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />	<br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />4,01.1,,10144 <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.ciov/readinchrm/doc-collections/nureqs/staff/srl 022/r3/ <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request 80 hours.

The actuation of the Auxiliary Feedwater System by the Steam Feedwater <br />Rupture Control System (SFRCS) on a valid high Steam Generator level is reportable within eight hours of <br />the event in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A). On September 10, 2016, at 0723 hours both of <br />these events were reported to the NRC Operations Center (Event Number 52232). <br />These issues are being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A), which requires reporting of <br />any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of the RPS, including a reactor scram or <br />reactor trip, as well as automatic actuation of the Auxiliary Feedwater System. All safety systems performed <br />as required to the event, and no loss of safety function occurred. <br />CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: <br />Completed Actions: <br />The four failed Turbine Building roof vents were closed on September 10, 2016, via a temporary modification <br />and tagged with instructions to not operate the roof vents without Senior Reactor Operator approval. <br />Additionally, an Operations Standing Order was issued on September 11, 2016, directing that the Operations <br />Manager's permission was required to open any of the roof vents. The Standing Order will remain in place <br />until configuration control steps are instituted in the Turbine Ventilation System Operating Procedure. <br />Five suspect modules in the ICS RFR Feedwater Loop 1 circuit were replaced with bench tested, refurbished <br />modules on September 14, 2016, and field testing of the affected portion of the RFR circuit for Feedwater <br />Loop 1 was performed and verified to function properly. The five modules removed were sent to a laboratory <br />for failure analysis, which identified the most probable cause of the operational amplifier degradation on <br />Module 5-6-6. Because of this degraded operational amplifier, all 14 spare signal lag modules in stock had <br />the same operational amplifier replaced. Additionally, the work documents used by the laboratory to refurbish <br />the ICS modules has been updated to require replacement of the operational amplifiers, transistors, and <br />diodes as part of the refurbishment. <br />The conduit penetrations on the top of the AVR cabinet has been sealed to prevent future water intrusion <br />events. While installed in the same location, the AVR cabinet that was installed in 2014 is physically different <br />than the old cabinet, and is more vulnerable to water pooling on top of the cabinet, allowing it to eventually <br />migrate inside the cabinet and affect the AVR circuitry. <br />Scheduled Actions: <br />A case study will be developed and presented to the Operations Senior Reactor Operators and to site <br />Superintendents and Managers focusing on information turnover, use of the station operational challenge list, <br />ensuring either compensatory or mitigating actions are addressed along with the ownership of directing these <br />measures, recognition of elevated risk issues, and understanding of issues prior to management review board <br />review of the issues. <br />The Turbine Building roof vent material deficiencies will be corrected. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) <br />	 Page 5 of 6 <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />	<br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />40.0 01[0,4. <br />	<br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.clov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nureqs/staff/srl 022/r3/ <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3160-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LER NUMBER <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />- 009 <br />Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station Unit 1 05000 - 	 346 YEAR <br />2016 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />- 00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: (continued) <br />The signal lag modules currently installed in the plant will be replaced with refurbished modules that have had <br />the operational amplifiers replaced as described above. <br />A multi-functional team will be assembled to perform a review of the ICS to address system performance <br />concerns. This review will include the following <br />1. Recommend additional testing of the ICS RFR circuitry to verify system functions that are not checked <br />during normal plant startups. <br />2. Evaluate additional monitoring equipment to ensure RFR functions as required. <br />3. Evaluate ICS module classifications to determine if single point vulnerabilities exist. <br />4. Review industry operating experience for scram reduction recommendations, and verify lessons learned <br />have been incorporated. <br />5. Evaluate outstanding ICS modifications and recommendations for modifications to improve the reliability <br />of the ICS Feedwater control. <br />PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS: <br />There have been no Licensee Event Reports (LERs) at the DBNPS in the past three years that were the <br />result of rainwater intrusion. <br />LER 2016-001 documents a Reactor trip at the DBNPS on January 29, 2016, with an actuation of the SFRCS <br />on high Steam Generator Level. In the January 2016 event, the RFR circuit did not actuate due to a miswired <br />RFR defeat switch module that was installed in a previous outage. For the September 10, 2016 trip, the RFR <br />circuit actuated, but only controlled level on one of the two Steam Generators, likely due to a degraded <br />operational amplifier resulting in a module providing a faulty output. The corrective actions taken in response <br />to the January 2016 event would not have prevented the September 10, 2016 event. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 6 of 6<br /></span>
