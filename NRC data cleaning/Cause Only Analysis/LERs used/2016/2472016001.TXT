ABSTRACT (Limit to 1400 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced type written lines) <br />On March 4, 2016, during the performance of surveillance procedure 2-PT-R006, Main Steam <br />Safety Valve (MSSV) MS-45B failed to lift within the Technical Specification (TS) as- <br />' 	 found required range of +/- 3% of the setpoint pressure. 	 Valve MS-45B lifted at 1125 <br />psig, 29 psig outside its acceptance range of 1034 to 1096 psig and 5.7% above its 1065 <br />psig setpoint. 	 The valve was declared inoperable, then subsequently restored to <br />operability upon two successful lifts within the required setpoint range without the <br />need for adjustment. 	 Nine other MSSVs that were tested lifted within the as-found <br />required setpoint range. 	 The apparent cause for the failure was internal friction due <br />to spindle rod wear, which causes the spindle rod to bind against internal components. <br />Corrective actions were modification of MS-45B and twelve other MSSVs, and the <br />replacement of their spindle rods. 	 The event had no effect on public health and safety. <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(01-2017) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />FACILITY NAME (1) DOCKET (2) LER NUMBER (6) PAGE (3) <br />YEAR <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER  <br />REVISION <br />NUMBER <br />Indian Point Unit 2  05000-247  2016 	 001 	 00  2 OF 5 <br />NARRATIVE (if more space is required, use additional copies of NRC Form 366A) (17) <br />Note: 	 The Energy Industry Identification System Codes are identified within the <br />brackets {} <br />DESCRIPTION OF EVENT <br />On March 4, 2016 at 1116 hours, while at approximately 79 percent power, during <br />surveillance testing of the Main Steam Safety Valves (MSSV) in accordance with <br />procedure 2-PT-R006, MSSV MS-45B on Steam Generator (SG) 22 failed to lift within <br />the-Technical Specification (TS) as-found required range of +/- 3% of the required <br />setpoint pressure. Valve MS-45B lifted at 1125 psig, 29 psig outside its setpoint <br />range of 1034 to 1096 psig and 5.7% above its 1065 psig setpoint. Consequently, <br />MS-45B was declared inoperable and Technical Specification (TS) 3.7.1 (Main Steam <br />Safety Valves) Condition A was entered. Two immediate subsequent tests were <br />performed without any adjustments required and the valve lifted at 1038 psig and <br />1037 psig. With the valve lifting within the required setpoint range, the valve <br />was restored to operability, allowing exit from the TS 3.7.1 Action Statement at <br />1126 hours. During the surveillance test, nine (9) other MSSVs that were tested <br />passed their-as-found test criteria and were left within the +/- 1% set point <br />criteria. The failure of MS-45B was recorded in the Indian Point Energy Center <br />(IPEC) Corrective Action Program (CAP) as Condition Report CR-IP2-2016-01204. <br />During the performance of the 6-year Internal Inspection Preventive Maintenance <br />(PM) activity on MS-45B completed on Match 31, 2016 during refueling outage 2R22, <br />numerous dimensions, clearances, and tolerances were verified and internal <br />components were inspected for wear/damage. The valve spindle rod was found to have <br />areas of wear along its length arid around the circumference in the form of small <br />steps, which is attributed to system vibration during power operation. All other <br />inspection criteria were satisfactory. - <br />There are five code safety valves (MSSVs) and one atmospheric dump valve (ADV) {RV} <br />on each main steam (MS) line outside the Reactor Containment {NH} and upstream of <br />the MS isolation valves {ISV}. The MSSVs consist of four 6-inch by 10-inch and one <br />6-inch by 8-inch valve per SG on each of four MS lines for a total of 20 valves. <br />The five valves'on each steam line are nominally set to open at 1065, 1080, 1095, <br />1110, and 1120 psig. The MSSVs are ASME Code relief valves, manufactured by <br />Crosby-Ashton {C710}. Valve MS-45B is a 6-inch by 8-inch Model HA-65W Safety <br />Valve. <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(01-2017) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />FACILITY NAME (1) DOCKET (2) LER NUMBER (6) PAGE (3) <br />YEAR <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER  <br />REVISION <br />NUMBER <br />Indian Point Unit 2  05000-247  2016 	 001 	 00 3 OF 5 <br />CAUSE OF EVENT <br />The apparent cause for the failure was internal friction due to spindle rod wear, <br />which causes the spindle rod to bind against internal components. High vibrations <br />of the spindle rod caused friction between the rod, spring washer, and adjusting <br />bolt. The vibration of the spindle rod while in contact with the spring washer and <br />adjusting bolt resulted in severe wear in the form of steps on the spindle rod. The <br />resulting frictional force occurs on the first lift and then does not repeat. <br />The vendor's solution to the problem is to install sacrificial bronze wear sleeves <br />along the inner diameter of the spindle rod contact points (inner diameters of the <br />adjusting bolt, upper spring washer, and lower spring washer). The spring washers <br />and adjusting bolt are machined to accept the bronze wear sleeves, which act as a <br />sacrificial metal, preventing spindle wear and step formation. One-sleeve is <br />installed in each of the spring washers and two sleeves are installed in the <br />adjusting bolt. <br />An extent of condition (EOC) was performed to determine where potential conditions <br />with similar valves, design, systems, and environments could occur. The review <br />determined that the EOC found in the failure of MS-45B is restricted to the other 19 <br />MSSVs at Unit 2 and the 20 MSSVs at Unit 3 due to the excluive valve design. All <br />MSSVs are exposed to high vibrations during their operating cycle during which wear <br />can occur. Previous failures of MSSVs have included wear due to spring skewing and <br />-setpoint drift.' Spring skewing can occur in any of the MSSVs and cause side loading <br />frictional forces which prevent the valve from lifting. Setpoint drift can occur due <br />to age of the components and the operating cycle it is exposed to (e.g., changes in <br />temperature, pressure and vibrations). <br />PAST SIMILAR EVENTS <br />A-review was performed of LicenseeEVent Reports (LERs) for any events reporting TS <br />prohibited conditions due to MSSV test failures. LER 2010-002 reported two MSSV <br />failures, one due to valve spring skew and the other due to setpoint drift. <br />	 LER <br />2012-005 reported one MSSV outside the required as-found lift setpoint range due to <br />spring skew/spindle wear. <br />The MSSVs at Unit 2 are the same as those at Unit 3, and LERs have reported MSSV <br />test failures at Unit 3. LER-2011-004 reported two MSSVs outside the required as-<br />found lift setpoint ranges due to spindle wear and spring skew. LER-2013-001 <br />reported two MSSVs outside the required as-found lift setpoint ranges due to galling <br />around the circumference of the spindle rod as a result of vibration for one valve, <br />and internal friction caused by foreign material between the guide bearing and <br />spindle for the other valve. LER 2015-002 reported three MSSVs outside the required <br />as-found lift setpoint ranges due to internal friction from spindle rod vibration. <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(01-2017) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />FACILITY NAME (1) DOCKET (2) LER NUMBER (6) PAGE (3) <br />YEAR <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER  <br />REVISION <br />NUMBER <br />Indian Point Unit 2  05000-247  2016 _ 001 	 00  4 OF 5 <br />NARRATIVE (If more space is required, use additional copies of NRC Form 366A) (17) <br />CORRECTIVE ACTIONS <br />A modification was initiated in 2011 to install bronze wear sleeves in the upper <br />and lower spring washers and the adjusting bolt as a solution to valve spring skew <br />and spindle wear for the IPEC MSSVs. This modification was completed for 7 of the <br />20 Unit 2 MSSVs in the 2014 refueling outage (2R21). Valve MS-45B and the 12 other <br />MSSVs that were not modified in 2R21 were modified in the 2016 refueling outage <br />(2R22). New spindles were also installed in these 13 MSSVs in 2R22. All 20 MSSVs <br />have been modified with the bronze wear sleeves. <br />EVENT ANALYSIS <br />The event is reportable under 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). The licensee shall report any <br />operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant TS. TS 3.7.1 (Main Steam <br />Safety Valves). requires the MSSVs to be operable.in accordance with TS Table8 3.7.1-1 <br />and 3.7.1-2. The applicable accident/transient analyses require five MSSVs per SG to <br />provide overpressure protection for design basis transients occurring at 10296 reactor <br />thermal power. The MSSVs also provide a heat sink for the Reactor Coolant System if <br />the Main Condenser is unavailable and the ADVs cannot relieve steam line pressure. <br />Operability of the MSSVs is defined as the ability to open within the setpoint range, <br />relieve SG overpressure, and reseat when pressure has been reduced, and is determined <br />by periodic surveillance testing. TS Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.7.1.1 requires <br />that each MSSV be verified to lift at its required setpoint per Table 3.7.1-2 in <br />accordance with the Inservice Testing Program (IST). On March 4, 2016, MSSV valve <br />MS-45B was found outside its required setpoint range, therefore, it failed its as-<br />found testing criteria and was declared inoperable. The valve was disassembled and <br />inspected and determined to have conditions preventing proper operation. .The <br />apparent cause determined that failure was due to internal friction caused by spindle <br />rod wear from vibration during the operating cycle. Spindle wear is not normal <br />drift, therefore, the valve may have been inoperable during past operation. AS it is <br />not possible to determine when the valve would not have lifted within its required <br />setpoint range, the valve was concluded to be inoperable for greater than the TS <br />allowed completion time. An evaluation of applicable accident/transient analyses was <br />performed to determine the impact of one MSSV with a higher opening setpoint. The <br />evaluation concluded the condition would not have resulted in a loss of Safety <br />function. Therefore, this condition is not reportable under 10cFR50.73(a)(2)(v) as a <br />safety system functiOnal failure. <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(01-2017) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />FACILITY NAME (1) DOCKET (2) LER NUMBER (6) PAGE (3) <br />YEAR <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER  <br />REVISION <br />NUMBER <br />Indian Point Unit 2  05000-247  2016 	 001 _ 00  5 OF 5 <br />NARRATIVE• (If more space is required, use additional copies of NRC Form 366A) (17) <br />SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE <br />This event had no effect on the health and safety of the public. There were no <br />actual safety consequences for the event because there were no accidents or <br />transients requiring the MSSVs. <br />There was no significant potential safety impact of the condition under reasonable <br />and credible alternate conditions. Had an accident or transient occurred during <br />the condition of the out of tolerance MSSV, the condition would not have <br />significantly affected accident mitigation capability and the MSSVs overpressure <br />function would have been adequate. The design basis of the MSSVs is to limit the <br />secondary system pressure to 110% of design pressure when passing 100% of design <br />steam flow. Each MS line has an ADV capable of releasing steam to the atmosphere. <br />The ADVs have the capability to relieve approximately 10% of total steam. <br />The MSSV design -basis is sufficient to cope with any anticipated operational <br />occurrence or accident considered in the Design Basis Accident and transient <br />analysis. The events that challenge the relieving capacity of the MSSVs, and thus <br />Reactor Coolant System pressure, are those characterized as decreased heat removal <br />events, whose evaluations are presented in UFSAR Chapter 14. Of these, the full <br />power loss of external electrical load without steam dump is the limiting event. <br />The limiting UFSAR Chapter 14 transients which do not credit the ADVs and which <br />are impacted by the higher MSSV setpoint were evaluated and it was concluded that <br />the acceptance criteria for'the transients would have been met with the out of <br />tolerance MSSV.<br /></span>
