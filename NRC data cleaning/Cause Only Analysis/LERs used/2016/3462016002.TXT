The trip was a result of a feedwater isolation valve being opened to align the Motor Driven <br />Feed Pump's (MDFP) discharge to SG 1. The unexpected SFRCS SG 1 Reverse D/P Trip resulted in <br />the closure of the appropriate Main Steam and Main Feedwater (MFW) valves, as designed. AFW <br />Pumps 1 and 2 remained in operation, as expected and the plant was verified to be stable. <br />The cause of this event was inadequate procedural guidance contained in the Trip Recovery Procedure <br />with a corrective action to revise the procedure. This report is being submitted as an event that resulted <br />in an automatic actuation of the SFRCS, therefore, reportable in accordance with 10 CFR <br />50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A). <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours. <br />Reported lessons learned are incorporated into the licensing process and fed back to industry. <br />Send comments regarding burden estimate to the FOIA, Privacy and Information Collections <br />Branch (T-5 F53), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, or <br />by intemet e-mail to Infocollects.Resource@nrc.gov, and to the Desk Officer, Office of <br />Information and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB-10202, (3150-0104), Office of Management and <br />Budget, Washington, DC 20503.

The SFRCS <br />is required to ensure an adequate feedwater supply to the steam generators to, remove reactor decay <br />heat during periods when the normal feedwater supply and/or the electric power supply to essential <br />auxiliaries has been lost. The design of the SFRCS is to mitigate release of high energy steam, to <br />automatically start the AFW System in the event of a main steam line or Main Feedwater (MFW) line <br />rupture, or on the loss of both main feed pumps [SJ-P] or the loss of all four Reactor Coolant Pumps <br />(RCPs) [AB-P], and to prevent steam generator overfill and subsequent spillover into the main steam <br />lines. The SFRCS also provides a trip signal to the Anticipatory Reactor Trip System (ARTS). In the <br />event of a main steam line rupture, the SFRCS will close both Main Steam Isolation Valves (MSIVs) <br />[SB-ISV] and all MFW control [SJ-LCV] and stop valves [SJ-ISV] and trip the main turbine [TA-TRB]. <br />A loss of normal feedwater is sensed by monitoring the differential pressure across the main feedwater <br />check valves. On a high reverse differential pressure, the SFRCS opens the steam supply from either <br />steam generator to either auxiliary feedwater pump turbine and aligns the auxiliary feedwater pump to its <br />associated steam generator. SFRCS also isolates MFW, main steam, and trips the reactor and the main <br />turbine. On a reduced steam generator(s) inventory, the SFRCS responds similarly, with the exception <br />that MFW and main steam will not be isolated. <br />DESCRIPTION OF EVENT: <br />On January 29, 2016, at 1322 hours, the DBNPS experienced a reactor trip and subsequent SFRCS <br />actuation on SG 1 High Level. This resulted in various automatic actions, including the isolation of MFW <br />to the SGs and starting both trains of AFW. The Plant was stable in Mode 3 with the AFW System <br />providing AFW to the SGs, as designed. Refer to LER 2016-001 for more information on the January 29, <br />2016 events. <br />On January 30, 2016, with the plant remaining in Mode 3, Operations personnel were proceeding with <br />Post Trip recovery actions using procedure DB-OP-06910, Trip Recovery, to transition from AFW to <br />MFW supplying feedwater to the SGs. The Motor Driven Feedwater Pump (MDFP) was started and <br />operated on minimum recirculation flow back to the Deaerator. The MDFP discharge flowpath was then <br />aligned to the MFW system to refill and pressurize the downstream MFW header through the individual <br />Minimum Bypass Throttle Valves (FW139, FW44) up to the closed MFW Isolation Valves (FW612, <br />FW601). The MDFP continued to deliver feedwater to the MFW header establishing a stable FW <br />pressure upstream of the Minimum Bypass Throttle Valves (FW139, FW44). The MDFP flow remained <br />steady at approximately 12-15 gallons per minute for approximately 5 minutes. In accordance with <br />procedure DB-OP-06910, Operations personnel verified MFW pressure upstream of the Minimum <br />Bypass Throttle Valves (FW139 and FW44) was greater than SG pressure. MFW to SG 2 Isolation <br />Valve (FW601) was opened and in approximately 1 minute, MFW to SG 1 Isolation Valve (FW612) was <br />opened. This resulted in a reverse delta pressure indication across the MFW check valve at 0123 hours <br />as MFW to SG 1 Isolation Valve (FW612) was opened, resulting in an automatic actuation of the SFRCS <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours. <br />Reported lessons learned are incorporated into the licensing process and fed back to industry. <br />Send comments regarding burden estimate to the FOIA, Privacy and Information Collections <br />Branch (T-5 F53), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, or <br />by internet e-mail to Infocollects.Resource@nrc.gov, and to the Desk Officer, Office of <br />Information and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB,10202, (3150-0104), Office of Management and <br />Budget, Washington, DC 20503.

LER NUMBER <br />1. FACILITY NAME <br />Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station Unit 1 <br />2. DOCKET NUMBER <br />05000-346 <br />SEQUENTIA <br />NUMBER <br />- 002 <br />YEAR <br />2016 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />00 <br />DESCRIPTION OF EVENT (Continued) <br />on High Reverse Differential Pressure and realignment of several valves in the Main Steam Feedwater <br />System as designed. AFW continued to operate throughout the event and the Plant was verified to be <br />stable. <br />CAUSE OF EVENT <br />The direct cause of the event was insufficient pressure in the piping upstream of the MFW to SG 1 <br />Check valve (FW147), resulting in the SFRCS Actuation. When MFW to SG 1 Isolation Valve (FW612) <br />was opening, the downstream SG pressure of approximately 870 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) <br />was immediately applied to the downstream side of MFW to SG 1 Check Valve (FW147), developing <br />greater than 125 pounds per square inch differential (psid) reverse DP, thus causing the SFRCS SG 1 <br />High Reverse DP trip. The unexpected SFRCS SG 1 High Reverse D/P trip resulted in the reclosure of <br />affected valves, including the MFW Isolation Valves, as designed. The AFW Pumps remained in <br />operation, as expected. The MDFP remained operating aligned to the MFW Header and continued to <br />pressurize the piping between the FW Heaters up to the MFW Isolation Valves. <br />The apparent cause of the event is that less than adequate procedural guidance is contained in <br />procedure DB-OP-06910, Trip Recovery. The guidance in this procedure was inadequate to ensure that <br />the MFW piping segment between MFW Bypass Throttle Valve (FW139) and MFW to SG 1 Isolation <br />Valve (FW612) was sufficiently pressurized prior to opening MFW to SG 1 Isolation Valve (FW612).. <br />ANALYSIS OF EVENT <br />The SFRCS is a protection system required to actuate AFW to the SG's to remove reactor decay heat <br />during periods when normal feedwater supply has been lost and/or upon loss of power to the RCP <br />motors. Crossover piping exists that may be used to direct feedwater from either AFW source to either <br />SG. The SFRCS also functions to isolate steam and main feedwater lines to mitigate overcooling events <br />caused by steam depressurization: <br />At the time of the event, the AFW System was operating and feeding the Steam Generators. The unit <br />remained in Mode 3 and stable. This actuation did not have any negative impact to the AFW system and <br />the ability to feed the steam generators. <br />A bounding quantitative evaluation of risk impact was performed, using best available information, which <br />estimated the delta Core Damage Frequency (CDF) to be 4.9E-07/yr. Based on this analysis, this event <br />is considered to have a very low safety significance. <br />Reportability Discussion: <br />The Auxiliary Feedwater System by the SFRCS on a valid reverse differential pressure is reportable <br />within 8 hours of the event in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A). This notification was <br />completed at 07:32 on January 30, 2016 (Event Number 51702). The receipt of an actuation signal of <br />the Auxiliary Feedwater System and the actuation/closure of several main steam system valves is <br />reportable as a Licensee Event Report per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A). All safety systems performed as <br />required in response to the event, and no loss of safety function occurred. <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />	NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION' <br />(11-2015) <br />.,001 REG, ,4 4\  <br />4' 	<br />I,— ,/. 	 • <br />. 	 1104 <br />v+ . .

This verification will require the <br />installation of a temporary pressure indicator(s). <br />PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS <br />Licensee Event Report (LER) 2015-002 documents the manual actuation of SFRCS in May 2015 to <br />isolate a steam leak in the turbine building. LER 2016-001 documents the automatic actuation of <br />SFRCS on January 29, 2016, in response to high SG levels following a reactor trip. There have been no <br />LERs at the DBNPS involving an SFRCS reverse differential pressure trip in the past three years. <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015)<br /></span>
