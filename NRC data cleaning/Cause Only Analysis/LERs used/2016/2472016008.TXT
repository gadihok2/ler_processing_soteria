In accordance with Generic Letter 89-13 <br />program guidance and ASME Code case N-513-3 the weld was evaluated and determined <br />acceptable but required to be repaired prior to start-up from the 2016 spring <br />refueling outage (RO) (2R22). The degradation mechanism leading to the leak was <br />likely crevice corrosion. Leakage was seen to emanate at the weld toe, on the carbon <br />steel side. The leak was recorded in Indian Point Energy Center (IPEC) corrective <br />action program (CAP) as CR-IP2-2015-05358 and repairs scheduled to be performed <br />during the upcoming spring refueling outage (RO) starting March 7, 2016. The copper-<br />nickel to carbon steel weld joints in the CCW to SW piping are the only known welds <br />on site with this configuration. A flaw characterization and full pipe circumference <br />examination of this weld found that the leak was a localized area of corrosion. <br />Another area of thinning at one other circumferential location on the same weld was <br />identified, but the weld thickness in that area met minimum wall thickness <br />requirements and was designated for continued monitoring with no immediate action <br />necessary. <br />To support the weld repair plan, from December 17, 2015 to February 8,.2016, a <br />draft Entergy Welding Procedure Specification (WPS) was developed for welding P34 <br />90/10 copper-nickel base material to P1 carbon steel base material. ERNiCu-7 was <br />chosen as the filler metal. Two separate weld test coupons were prepared to <br />qualify the procedure and were shipped to the weld test lab (Lucius Pitkin Inc.) <br />for procedure qualification testing. Test results were obtained on March 3, 2016, <br />which showed one of the four bend tests failed due to inclusions in the root of the <br />weld joint resulting in a failure to qualify the procedure. On March 4, 2016, <br />vendors are contacted to determine if they have a qualified welding procedure for <br />copper-nickel to carbon steel. Only one vendor (Westinghouse PCI) had a qualified <br />procedure using the ERCuNi filler metal. Due to the limited time available to <br />repeat the procedure qualification testing prior to scheduled work, the weld repair <br />was contracted to the vendor with the approved qualified procedure for welding P34 <br />90/10 copper-nickel to P1 carbon steel using the ERCuNi filler metal. <br />On March 7, 2016, the Unit 2 Refueling Outage (RO) started. Repairs to the 21 CCW <br />Heat Exchanger SW line #411 pinhole leak were scheduled to be performed on March 18 <br />through March 19, 2016. On March 19, 2016, weld repairs, including excavation, <br />weld build-up, and post-repair non-destructive examination (NDE) of the flaw on <br />weld F-1924 was completed. On June 4, 2016, a In-service Leak Test (ISLT) of the <br />SW system was completed satisfactorily. No leaks identified. <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />Page 2 of 7 <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />1.

The leak was estimated at 1 drop per 5 seconds <br />in the SW System piping supplying the 21 CCW HX. The leak was on the elbow side at <br />the toe of the elbow to inlet nozzle weld of the 21 CCW HX on 20 inch SW line #411, <br />weld number F-1924. This line is the SW supply to the 21 CCW HX. SW line #411 is <br />a standard wall (schedule STD) cement-lined carbon steel pipe having a nominal wall <br />thickness of 0.375 inches. The nozzle/pipe of the 21 CCW HX is 90/10 copper/nickel <br />with a thickness of 0.500 inches. Its function is the inlet pipe to the 21 CCW HX. <br />SW line #411 is fed from either 20 inch SW line #411 (1-2-3 SW Header), or 20 inch <br />line #407 (4-5-6 SW Header). At the time of discovery, the 1-2-3 SW header was the <br />essential header supplying the 21 CCW HX. Leaking weld F-1924 is a dissimilar <br />metal butt-weld between a carbon steel cement-lined elbow and a copper-nickel heat <br />exchanger inlet nozzle/pipe. The weld location is ASME Section XI Class 3 and is <br />nuclear safety related. The SW pipe with the weld defect is located in the Primary <br />Auxiliary Building (PAB) on the 80 foot elevation downstream of valve SWN-34. <br />Engineering performed an Operability Evaluation using the methodology and <br />structural margins provide in ASME Code case N-513-3. The pipe weld degradation <br />was determined to be within the Code Case limits. The affected pipe section was <br />considered structurally acceptable therefore Operable DNC. An outage emergent team <br />designated to address the leak determined after discussions with site departments <br />that the leak did not have to be repaired until the next outage (2R23). The Mode 1 <br />hold was removed from the leak repair Work Order and the repair was designated to <br />be scheduled as soon as the work was ready to be performed. <br />On June 13, 2016, weld repairs were scheduled to be performed beginning June 21, <br />2016. Work migrated from the refueling outage schedule to the online schedule. The <br />preliminary schedule included 24 hours for the weld repair based on vendor input and <br />time estimates from the original 2R22 outage repair window. A leadership challenge <br />meeting discussed the weld plan because the online weld repair requires entry into a <br />Technical Specification (TS) 72 hour shutdown LCO due to removal of the 21 CCW HX <br />from service. <br />On June 16, 2016, a conference call was held with the weld vendor to discuss the <br />repair approach. The weld vendor and the Indian Point welding engineer concluded <br />the failure of the original weld repair was caused by contamination of the weld and <br />not as a result of any metallurgical issues with the vendor weld procedure. <br />Subsequent follow-up correspondence with the weld vendor questioned the possibility <br />of hot cracking of the ERCuNi filler metal due to iron dilution from the carbon <br />steel base material. The weld vendor's opinion was that using this process on this <br />configuration would not result in hot cracking. Peer review by another Entergy <br />site made the same conclusion. An Engineering Change was approved to repair the <br />weld defect from both the inner diameter and outer diameter of the pipe using the <br />vendor weld procedure on June 16, 2016. On June 16, 2016, at 23:30 hours, the unit <br />returns to service following an extended refueling outage. <br />Page 3 of 7 <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />1. FACILITY NAME 2.

At the CEM it was presented that the 2R22 <br />outage repair failed due to weld contamination that occurred because the repair was <br />attempted from the outside of the pipe only and since the cement lining surrounding <br />the repair cavity was not accessible for adequate cleaning around the weld joint, <br />resulting in contaminants becoming trapped in the weld that were not evident in the <br />final exam. In addition, a surface exam of the root pass was not specified to be <br />performed to ensure proper weld integrity below the surface of the finished weld. <br />Assurance was provided that the new plan would be successful due to a change in <br />work scope (internal access to the defect area, allow proper removal of cement <br />lining, clean affected area, perform a surface exam, weld build-up, adequate access <br />for purging and inspection/repair). The CEM also identified that the contingency <br />Enecon coating of internal piping following weld repairs was an excessive time <br />contributor. Therefore, the plan was altered to use a quick curing waterplug <br />coating repair to the inner piping wall. <br />On June 21, 2016, the TS 3.7.7 LCO was entered when the 21 CCW HX was declared <br />inoperable for scheduled maintenance. Work to repair the weld commenced. On June <br />22, 2016, during installation of the remainder of the copper-nickel to carbon steel <br />weld, workers identified repeated cracking problems and could not successfully <br />complete the weld. A leadership team conference was held to discuss the cracking <br />problem and determine a resolution plan. A decision was made to implement a revised <br />plan to grind out the defective copper-nickel to carbon steel weld area, perform a PT <br />exam on the excavated area, weld out the excavated area using a modified transverse <br />technique across the root gap and perform a final PT and UT. <br />On June 23, 2016, weld repairs were completed in accordance with the revised plan. <br />During the final inspection of the weld, the qualified inspector rejected the weld <br />based on incomplete weld penetration and appearance on the inside diameter (ID) of <br />the piping in the weld area. CR-IP2-2016-04085 recorded the unsatisfactory condition <br />of poor weld quality. Follow-up engineering discussions with the fleet welding <br />engineer and qualified inspector determined that the internal weld could not be <br />accepted and the weld would have to be removed and re-welded. At 14:30 hours, the <br />outage control center (OCC) issued a schedule update indicating that the 72 hour TS <br />AOT will expire prior to completing the revised plan for weld repairs and restoration <br />of the 21 CCW HX. <br />On June 24, 2016, at 04:00 hours, the TS 3.7.7 AOT expired forcing a unit shutdown. <br />The SW System (SWS) is designed to supply cooling water from the Hudson River to <br />various heat loads in both the primary and secondary portions of the plant. The <br />design ensures a continuous flow of cooling water to those systems and components <br />necessary for plant safety during normal operation and under abnormal or accident <br />conditions. The SWS consists of two separate, 100% capacity, safety related <br />cooling water headers. Each header is supplied by 3 pumps to include pump <br />strainers, with SWS heat loads designated as either essential or non-essential. <br />The essential SWS heat loads are those which must be supplied with cooling water <br />immediately in the event of a Loss of Cooling Accident (LOCA) and/or Loss of <br />Offsite Power (LOOP). The essential SWS heat loads can be cooled by any two of the <br />three SW pumps on the essential header. Either of the two SWS headers can be <br />aligned to supply the essential heat loads or the non-essential SWS heat loads. <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />Page 4 of 7 <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />1.

The CCWS transfers its heat load to the <br />SWS via heat exchangers. The SWS is a once through cooling system that transfers its <br />heat load. to the ultimate heat sink (Hudson River). The CCWS consists of three pumps <br />and two heat exchangers. These components are divided into two independent, full <br />capacity cooling loops with each loop consisting of one pump and one heat exchanger. <br />The principal safety related function of the CCW System is the removal of decay heat <br />from the reactor via the Residual Heat Removal (RHR) System during a normal or post <br />accident cooldown and shutdown. The design basis of the CCW System is for one CCW <br />train to remove the post loss of coolant accident (LOCA) heat load from the <br />containment sump during the recirculation phase of a LOCA. <br />An extent of condition (EOC) review determined that the copper-nickel to carbon steel <br />dissimilar weld configuration is unique to the 21 and 22 CCW HX inlet and outlet SW <br />piping. The 31 and 32 CCW HX inlet and outlet nozzles are rubber-lined carbon steel <br />flanged piping and are not susceptible to the same failure mechanism. CCW HX SW <br />piping weld EOC inspections at five similar locations were completed. No, new <br />problems or degraded conditions were identified. <br />CAUSE OF EVENT <br />The direct cause was recurring longitudinal solidification cracks that developed <br />during welding of copper-nickel to carbon steel pipe. The primary degradation <br />mechanism leading to the November '30, 2015 leak Was likely crevice corrosion, <br />caused by small holidays in the internal coating at the field weld that allowed SW <br />to contact the internal piping base metal. The corrosion promoted thinning in the <br />affected area, which resulted in the development of a pin hole at the weakened toe <br />of the carbon steel elbow to copper-nickel inlet nozzle field weld on the carbon <br />steel. Surface exams performed during the RO repairs did not identify any <br />defects. However, potential subsurface flaws would not be detected using the <br />surface exam technique. <br />During the RO and the June 2016 post outage repair work, repairs to the leaking <br />indication initially used ERCuNi filler metal to restore the weld integrity. This <br />method resulted in strain-induced longitudinal cracking in the highly restrained <br />joint due to the relatively low tensile strength of the material, its thermal <br />conductivity differences with carbon steel, and its susceptibility to iron <br />dilution from steel, which can increase the tendency for brittle fracture. <br />Standard industry practices to reduce cracking tendencies prior to joining <br />dissimilar metals with filler material were not identified in the repair plan. <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />Page 5 of 7 <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />Page 6 of 7 <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LER NUMBER <br />YEAR REV Na <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />2016 	 - 008 	 - 00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />The apparent cause was that the team assigned to prepare and execute the weld repair <br />plan failed to ensure all risks and issues were identified and managed properly. <br />This apparent cause resulted in this condition because risks were not identified and <br />work planning and scheduling did not include effective contingencies or back-out <br />criteria. Key team members contributing to work preparations did not effectively <br />perform their roles and responsibilities. There was inadequate preparation and lack <br />of rigor during planning and challenge reviews for the critical work activity. <br />CORRECTIVE ACTIONS <br />The following corrective actions have been or will be performed under the Corrective <br />Action Program (CAP) to address the causes of this event: <br />• A vendor (PCI) qualified a new copper-nickel to carbon steel weld procedure <br />using a different filler metal (ERNiCu-7) with better performance <br />characteristics based on industry best practices. An Engineering Change (EC) <br />was developed to eliminate the weld stresses that were contributing to the <br />observed in-process weld cracking. The defective weld and degraded piping <br />section was cut out and replaced with a flush welded patch according to the new <br />EC using the new filler metal (ERNICu-7) and the newly qualified vendor (PCI) <br />welding procedure. All welds were inspected according to the code-required <br />visual and surface examinations. The completed weld was leak tested and the 21 <br />CCW HX returned to service. <br />• The lessons learned from this event were discussed at the work week critique and <br />were communicated site-wide during all-hands meetings and through distribution of <br />the weekly newsletter. The message reinforced standards and expectations for <br />ensuring readiness. <br />• A System Outage Critique will be performed in accordance with EN-FAP-WM-003 to <br />communicate lessons learned with individuals involved with the weld repair <br />outage. <br />• Incorporate recommendations for improving risk management process effectiveness <br />by incorporating actions taken in response to INPO IER L2-16-9 Revision 0. <br />EVENT ANALYSIS <br />The event is reportable under 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(i)(A). The licensee shall report the <br />completion of any nuclear plant shutdown required by the plant's Technical <br />Specification (TS). The event meets the reporting requirement because on June 24, <br />2016, at 04:00 hours, operations implemented actions to commence reactor shutdown to <br />comply with TS 3.7.7 (CCW System). <br />Indian Point 2 05000-247 <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />Page 7 of 7 <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request 80 hours.

FACILITY NAME 3. LER NUMBER 2. DOCKET NUMBER <br />2016 	 - 008 	 - 00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />TS 3.7.7 LCO requires two CCW trains to be Operable. TS 3.7.7 Condition A (One CCW <br />train inoperable) required action A.1 is to restore the inoperable CCW train to <br />operable within 72 hours. TS 3.7.7 Condition A was entered on June 21, 2016, at <br />02:30 hours, when the 21 CCW HX was declared inoperable for scheduled maintenance. <br />On June 24, 2016, at 04:00 hours, the TS 3.7.7 AOT window expired forcing a unit <br />shutdown to comply with TS 3.7.7 Condition B which requires the plant to be in Mode 3 <br />within 6 hours and Mode 4 within 12 hours. On June 24, 2016, at 7:59 hours, a manual <br />reactor shutdown was completed and the plant entered Mode 3. At 12:58 hours, the <br />plant entered Mode 4. On June 24, 2016, at 04:05 hours, a four hour non-emergency <br />notification was made to the NRC (Log Number 52039) for a TS required shutdown. On <br />June 26, 2016, at 14:11 hours, the 21 CCW HX was declared operable and TS 3.7.7 <br />Condition B exited. Operations commenced plant start-up. Unit entered Mode 1 on <br />June 27, 2016, at 15:01 hours. The event was recorded in the Indian Point Energy <br />Center corrective action program (CAP) as CR-IP2-2016-04118. <br />PAST SIMILAR EVENTS <br />A review of the past three years of Licensee Event Reports (LERs) for events that <br />involved a TS required shutdown due to faulty SW pipe repair. No applicable LERs <br />were identified. <br />SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE <br />This condition had no effect on the health and safety of the public. <br />There were no actual safety consequences for the event because there were no events <br />impacting redundant components. <br />There were no significant potential safety consequences of this condition. The CCW <br />System provides a heat sink for the removal of process and operating heat from safety <br />related components during a design basis accident (DBA) or transient. The CCW System <br />consists of three pumps and two heat exchangers. The CCW pumps are connected to a <br />common discharge header that is arranged so that any of the three pumps will supply <br />either CCW heat exchanger and the heat exchangers are connected to a common discharge <br />header so that both heat exchangers supply all CCW System heat loads. Any one of the <br />three CCW pumps in conjunction with any one of the two CCW heat exchangers is <br />sufficient to accommodate the normal and post-accident heat load. For this event one <br />CCW Heat Exchanger was removed from service to perform a weld repair. The remaining <br />redundant CCW HX and associated components were operable and available to perform <br />their safety function. <br />A risk evaluation was performed to estimate the increase in core damage probability <br />(CDP) and large early release probability (LERP) using a baseline zero maintenance <br />plant configuration and the 21 CCW HX outage time of 5 days. The results of the risk <br />evaluation concluded the risk impact associated with the inoperability of the 21 CCW <br />Heat Exchanger is non-risk significant per NRC Regulatory Guide 1.177 (i.e., the <br />increase in CDP is less than 1E-6/year and the increase in LERP is less than <br />1E-7/year) <br />Indian Point 2 05000-247 <br />YEAR SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />REV <br />Na <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015)<br /></span>
