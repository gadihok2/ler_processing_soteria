Personnel <br />were removing disassembled scaffolding from inside the crane wall on the 46 foot <br />elevation of containment and moving it through the ECCS sump barrier gates {GATE} to <br />areas outside the crane wall through the two open barrier gates. Having both sump <br />barrier gates open violated ECCS operability basis which requires the sump barrier <br />system to be operable in Modes 1-4. The plant had entered Mode 4 on July 10, 2016, <br />at 23:30 hours. The inspector notified the operator touring with him of the <br />observation. The operator subsequently coached the Radiation Protection (RP) door <br />guard to ensure that one of the gates were closed at all times. No condition report <br />recorded the event at the time. Subsequently, on June 20, 2016, after an NRC <br />inspector advised a site manager the condition was recorded in the Indian Point <br />Energy Center (IPEC) Corrective Action Program (CAP) as Condition Report CR-IP2-<br />2016-04036. On June 21, 2016, CR-IP2-2016-04037 recorded the failure to initiate a <br />CR at the time of the event. <br />For postulated breaks in the Reactor Coolant System (RCS) {AB} there are two <br />recirculation related sumps within the containment, 1) the Recirculation Sump and, <br />2) the Containment Sump. Both sumps collect liquids discharged into the <br />containment during a design basis accident. As part of the resolution of Generic <br />Safety Issue (GSI)-191 (Assessment of Debris Accumulation on PWR Sump Performance) <br />and Generic Letter 2004-02 (Potential Impact of Debris Blockage on Emergency <br />Recirculation During Design Basis Accidents at Pressurized Water Reactors) various <br />flow barrier debris interceptors were installed in the containment to channel the <br />recirculation flow into the reactor cavity sump area, up and out of the Incore <br />Instrumentation Tunnel, through the crane wall and containment sump labyrinth wall <br />via specially designed openings, and into the annulus area outside the crane wall. <br />The recirculation flow will migrate towards the Recirculation Sump or the <br />Containment Sump depending on which pump(s) are operating. Flow channeling <br />barriers are installed on the Reactor Cavity Sump around the Incore Instrumentation <br />Tunnel, on the Recirculation Sump trenches, and at the Containment Sump. Flow <br />channeling barrier gates are installed in the northeast and northwest quadrant <br />openings of the Crane Wall. In addition, flow channeling barrier gates are <br />installed in the north and south entrances to the Recirculation Sump area. There <br />is one dual access gate (gates 17 and 23) to allow access without violating the <br />flow barrier integrity during transient through the flow barrier system. <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />Page 2 of 6 <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />1.

In accordance with procedure OAP-007 (Containment Entry and <br />Egress) the scaffold group was to assume the role of containment coordinator and be <br />responsible for performing a containment entry briefing. However, instead of <br />providing a containment entry briefing, a regular or standard HU pre-job brief was <br />given to the scaffold workers by their contractor supervisor. Because the area <br />being worked was a radiation controlled area the scaffold workers then met with <br />Radiation Protection (RP) personnel at the Health Physics access (HP1) for a Locked <br />High Radiation Area (LHRA) RP pre-job brief. The RP brief included discussion that <br />one of the ECCS barrier gates had to be closed at all times per GSI-191 and OAP-007 <br />requirements. The job also required an RP door guard whose only function was to <br />ensure that anyone entering into the inside crane wall had to have an HP individual <br />with them. There was no ECCS barrier gate monitor assignment as required by OAP-<br />007. As work progressed the scaffold workers left both ECCS barrier gates open to <br />enhance removal of scaffold material to storage. Although the scaffold workers <br />were told during the RP briefing that one ECCS barrier gate must remain closed at <br />all times, it was discovered in interviews with workers that they thought that none <br />of the other gates could be opened while they were using their gate location to <br />remove scaffold. <br />It was determined that the supplemental scaffold supervisor was not aware of a <br />specific entry procedure that was required to be used prior to a containment entry. <br />A specific OAP-007 procedure containment entry brief was not given to the workers <br />nor were they and their supervisor aware of the procedure. The supplemental <br />scaffold group supervisor stated that in previous containment entries he and his <br />group were never the main group going into containment so they were always briefed <br />by operations or RP and didn't recall using OAP-007. Procedure OAP-007 is <br />specifically written to cover many aspects of containment entries. The procedure <br />contains sections and steps discussing the ECCS barrier gates with diagrams of the <br />crane wall and all of the gates with their locations and numbers. If the procedure <br />had been used in addition to a pre-job and RP brief, the requirements would have <br />been clearer to the workers and this event most likely would not have occurred. <br />An extent of condition (EOC) review was performed and it determined that both units <br />are similar and both would be vulnerable in an event if there was a direct flow <br />path for accident debris to enter the containment/internal recirculation sump. The <br />condition is bounded by the crane wall gates as these are the only types of gates <br />in the containment installed in the crane wall that protect the ECCS sumps from <br />debris. <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />Page 3 of 6 <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />1.

The failure mode was personnel not being aware of <br />all available information. The scaffold supervisor was not aware of his <br />requirement to serve as containment coordinator and provide the required briefing <br />on gate closure. The RP brief was focused on the locked high radiation <br />requirements not gate control. <br />CORRECTIVE ACTIONS <br />The following corrective actions have been or will be performed under the Corrective <br />Action Program (CAP) to address the causes of this event: <br />• Dual gates were closed and applicable gate secured. The RP door guard was <br />coached on requirement to have at least one gate closed and secured at all <br />times. <br />• A HU meeting was held and interviews conducted with the work crew, supervisor and <br />RP personnel and the requirements of OAP-007 were reviewed and requirements of the <br />ECCS barrier reinforced. <br />• A Department Clock Reset/Yellow memo was prepared and the lessons learned on the <br />event and management expectations communicated with Projects organizations, all <br />site departments, and the Fleet. <br />• The event will be included in all 3R19 supplemental supervisors qualifications <br />required reading list. <br />• Procedure OAP-007 will be revised to include a checklist for entry briefings to <br />include GS-191 requirements. <br />EVENT ANALYSIS <br />The event is reportable under 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) as a safety system functional <br />failure as the condition could have prevented adequate post accident core cooling <br />due to DBA debris blockage of the recirculation and/or the containment sump. An <br />ECCS train is inoperable if it is not capable of delivering design flow to the RCS. <br />Individual components are inoperable if they are not capable of performing their <br />design function or supporting systems are not available. Technical Specification <br />(TS) 3.5.2 (ECCS-Operating) requires three ECCS trains to be operable in Modes 1, 2 <br />and 3, and TS 3.5.3 (ECCS-Shutdown) requires one ECCS residual heat removal (RHR) <br />subsystem and one ECCS recirculation subsystem to be operable in Mode 4. <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />Page 4 of 6 <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

LER NUMBER <br />Indian Point 2 05000-247 <br />YEAR SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />REV <br />NO. <br />2016 	 - 	 007 	 - 	 00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />The licensing and design basis of the ECCS per UFSAR Section 6.2.2 (ECCS System <br />Design and Operation) credits flow channeling barriers installed in containment in <br />response to the resolution of GL-2004-02. The two flow barrier gates that were <br />used for removing scaffolding were not closed and secured to prevent it from being <br />forced open during a DBA. The unsecured gates were not in accordance with design <br />and not a sufficient robust barrier to prevent debris from entering the <br />recirculation and containment sumps had a DBA occurred while in Mode 4. The <br />condition is also reportable under 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(vii) (common cause <br />inoperability of independent trains or channels) as the condition caused at least <br />one independent train or channel to become inoperable in multiple systems or two <br />independent trains or channels to become inoperable in a single system designed to <br />(D) mitigate the consequences of an accident. The NRC inspector tour occurred <br />during the time the unit was in Mode 4. The unit entered Mode 4 on June 10, 2016, <br />at 23:30 hours. However, no CR was initiated for this condition at that time. CR-<br />IP2-2016-04037 recorded that condition that while performing a walkdown with an <br />NRC inspector on June 11, 2016, the NRC raised a question about an activity in the <br />field and no condition report was initiated. <br />PAST SIMILAR EVENTS <br />A review was performed of the past three years of Licensee Event Reports (LERs) for <br />events that involved SSFFs and/or common cause inoperability of an Engineered <br />Safety Feature System that had a similar cause. No LERs were identified at Unit 2. <br />A review of all reported events during the past three years at both units <br />identified one LER at Unit 3 that was similar. Unit 3 LER-2013-002 reported on <br />April 29, 2013, a Safety System Functional Failure and Common Cause Inoperability <br />of the Emergency Core Cooling System due to violation of containment sump debris <br />barrier integrity. The LER reported that on March 4, 2013, during shutdown for a <br />refueling outage, Radiation Protection (RP) personnel entered the reactor <br />containment building to install plastic RP fencing for the Reactor Coolant Drain <br />Tank (RCDT). After receiving clearance at Mode 4 to enter the Inner Crane Wall <br />(ICW) to install fencing around the RCDT and post it as a Locked High Radiation <br />Area (LHRA). The RP work crew assumed they could enter the ICW area through any <br />sump barrier gate for the Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS). The RP work crew <br />chose to use a single gate access point due to its proximity to the RCDT. <br />Subsequently, a RP Technician identified that personnel had not entered the area <br />using the double access gate and had brought in plastic fencing which was <br />inappropriate material for the sump area. The apparent causes were an inadequate <br />pre-job brief and inadequate procedure for Containment Entry and Egress (OAP-007, <br />0-RP-RWP-405) due to poor change management. The pre-job brief failed to cover the <br />requirement to use the dual sump barrier gate access point when in Modes 1-4, nor <br />did it address the type of fencing allowed. Corrective actions included revision <br />of Procedure OAP-007 to clearly state that within the procedure's attachments that <br />only the sump barrier dual access gate for 46 foot Containment ICW entries shall be <br />used in Modes 1-4. <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />Page 5 of 6 <br />NRC FORM 366 (11.-2015) <br />1.

Securing the gates at unit 3 which uses a <br />slide latch does not state the use of a gate monitor. The step for Unit 2 includes <br />statements that the gates be secured with a padlock or nut and bolt closure from the <br />outside. This condition requires posting of a gate monitor to allow exit. <br />SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE <br />This event had no significant effect on the health and safety of the public. There <br />were no actual safety consequences for the event because there were no accidents or <br />transients during the time of the event. The analysis performed in response to GL-<br />2004-02 included debris transport analysis conservatisms for transport of debris to <br />both the IR sump and the Containment sump in excess of quantities that would be <br />generated. Establishing normal RHR cooling to the RCS has RCS temperature below <br />350 degrees F and pressure less than 400 psig. <br />In Mode 4 the reactor is not critical and reactivity is stable. In Mode 4 there is <br />significantly less energy in the RCS to generate debris. At the time the actual RCS <br />pressure (pressurizer pressure) was approximately 355 psig. An evaluation of a <br />LOCA during Mode 3 and 4 operation was performed by Westinghouse (WCAP-12476) that <br />showed a direct reduction in break probability for Mode 4. The evaluation <br />concluded that Mode 4 LOCAs are not a significant contributor to shutdown risk. <br />During this event the entire flow barrier was not disabled because only two debris <br />barrier gates were unsecured and only for the time scaffold workers were allowed to <br />perform assigned work. The exact time the gates were open cannot be determined as <br />the barrier gates have no electronic timing devises. However, the scaffold workers <br />were assigned three entries with stay time limitations for heat stress of 45 <br />minutes each for a total job time of 135 minutes. The scaffold work assignment <br />took place in Mode 4. The unit entered Mode 4 on June 10, 2016, at 23:30 hours. <br />For the first two of three entries, the scaffold workers had to go inside the crane <br />wall and disassemble erected scaffolding. Per the scaffold supervisor at least one <br />door was closed during scaffold disassembly. Therefore approximately 60 minutes <br />were left for moving disassembled scaffolding from inside the crane wall through <br />the open gates to the outside crane wall storage areas. Therefore most debris <br />would have been intercepted by the flow barrier system. Also, the barrier gates <br />swing into the crane wall so that DBA flow and forces would tend to close the gate <br />when pressure is applied (e.g., DBA debris loads) therefore limit flow barrier <br />bypass and sump debris loading. <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />Page 6 of 6 <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015)<br /></span>
