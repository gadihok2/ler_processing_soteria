All <br />emergency core cooling systems and emergency safeguards feature systems functioned as <br />expected. The motor driven and steam driven auxiliary feed pumps started as expected on steam <br />generator low level. Operators stabilized the plant in Mode 3 with decay heat removal via the main <br />steam dump valves and auxiliary feed water system. Condenser vacuum remained available for the <br />duration of the event. Operators also ensured a normal offsite electrical power lineup. Investigation <br />identified a Stator Water Cooling valve leak dripping onto a relay, shorting the relay wiring <br />terminations. This caused the turbine generator trip. <br />This report is being made in accordance with 10CFR50.73 (a)(2)(iv)(A), "Any event or <br />condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in <br />paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B)," for this event actuation of the Reactor Protection System and the <br />Auxiliary Feedwater System. <br />NRC FORM 366 (02-2014) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 <br />	 EXPIRES: 01131/2017 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 <br />hours.

The trip was initiated due to a Main Turbine trip caused by a Main Generator <br />Protection signal. All emergency core cooling systems and emergency safeguards feature <br />systems functioned as expected. The motor driven and steam driven auxiliary feed pumps <br />started as expected on steam generator low level. Operators stabilized the plant in Mode 3 <br />with decay heat removal via the main steam dump valves and auxiliary feed water system. <br />Condenser vacuum remained available for the duration of the event. Operators also ensured <br />a normal offsite electrical power lineup. <br />Walk down of the Stator Water Cooling (SWC) Panel identified a SWC valve leak inside a panel <br />that was dripping onto an agastat relay {TB/RLY}, shorting the wiring terminations for contact 1-5. <br />The leak was noted at the packing associated with an equalizing valve. Water leaked from the <br />valve down the panel, and into one of two Agastat Stator Water trip relays. The relay filled with <br />water and internally shorted closing the normally open trip contact causing the generator to trip. <br />During the walkdown there were no other water leaks noted within the panel. It should be noted that <br />the developed leak could be related to aging and usage over time which resulted in a loose valve <br />packing nut. All other valves within the panel were verified to be wrench tight without signs of <br />leaking and all tubing appeared to be visually intact without signs of leaking.

LER NUMBER a PAGE <br />YEAR SEQUENTIAL REVISION <br />Salem Generating Station — Unit 2 05000311 <br />NUMBER NUMBER <br />3 OF 4 <br />2016 	 - 003 	 - 000 <br />panels did not include electrical trip relays with process tubing, where a similar failure could cause a trip. <br />The Unit 1 Generator was walked down and it was noted that Stator water trip devices <br />(pressure/flow) were non-panel mounted external units. Outside of the flow and pressure switches <br />themselves, the Salem Unit 1 design differs from the Unit 2 tripping scheme using stand-alone <br />devices. There were no active leaks noted at Salem Unit 1 at this time. <br />This report is being made in accordance with 10CFR50.73 (a)(2)(iv)(A), "Any event or condition that <br />resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B)," for <br />this event actuation of the Reactor Protection System and the Auxiliary Feedwater System. <br />Notification of this event was provided via ENS report 51734. <br />CAUSE OF EVENT <br />The direct cause for Salem Unit 2 turbine generator trip was a stator bushing cooling water flow <br />switch equalizing valve leak that caused shorting of an agastat relay contact. Shorting this contact <br />resulted in the turbine generator trip. The apparent cause of the generator trip is that the agastat <br />relay had not been identified as a single point vulnerability. Therefore, the relay did not have a <br />mitigation/elimination strategy. <br />SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS <br />There were no safety consequences as a result of this event. Operators appropriately responded to <br />the reactor trip to stabilize the plant. All emergency core cooling systems and emergency safeguards <br />feature systems functioned as expected. The motor driven and steam driven auxiliary feed pumps <br />started as expected on steam generator low level. Operators stabilized the plant in Mode 3 with <br />decay heat removal via the main steam dump valves and auxiliary feed water system. Condenser <br />vacuum remained available for the duration of the event. Operators also ensured a normal offsite <br />electrical power lineup. <br />SAFETY SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL FAILURE <br />This condition did not result a safety system functional failure as defined in NEI 99-02, Regulatory <br />Assessment Performance Indicator Guidelines. <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION  APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 01/31/2017 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request 80 <br />hours, Reported lessons learned are incorporated into the licensing process and fed back <br />to Industry, Send comments regarding burden estimate to the FOIA, Privacy and <br />Information Collections Branch (T-5 F53), U.S, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, <br />Washington, DC 20565-0001, or by Internet e-mail to Infocollects.Resource@nrcgov, and to <br />the Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB-1 0202, (3150-0104), Office <br />of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, If a means used to impose an Information <br />collection does not display a currently valid OMB control number, the NRC may not conduct or <br />sponsor, and a person Is not required to respond to, the information collection. <br />(02-2014) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />1.
