The intended design of the EGTS swap-over <br />circuit was to detect an actual failure of the control path in A-Auto and swap to the Standby control path. The <br />unnecessary automatic swap to Standby could prevent the EGTS train, configured in A-Auto, from <br />performing its required safety function during a DBE. On August 5, at 1658 eastern daylight time (EDT), the <br />condition was resolved when the automatic swap-over circuit was disabled. On August 17, at 1722 EDT a <br />past operability evaluation determined the configuration of the EGTS flow controllers constituted an <br />unanalyzed condition that significantly degraded plant safety due to the EGTS not meeting single failure <br />criteria. Engineering analysis determined that the failure of both trains of EGTS controllers would not result <br />in exceeding 10 CFR 100 limits. The cause of the event was that the EGTS control circuitry was not <br />designed to account for situations that should have been anticipated.

PLANT OPERATING CONDITIONS BEFORE THE EVENT <br />At the time of the event, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Unit 1 and Unit 2 were in Mode 1 at <br />100 percent rated thermal power. <br />II. DESCRIPTION OF EVENTS <br />A. Event: <br />On August 2, 2016, during review of the Emergency Gas Treatment System (EGTS) [EIIS: BH] <br />circuits, Engineering discovered that the EGTS may automatically swap from the flow control <br />path in A-Auto to the Standby flow control path upon the start of a design basis event (DBE). <br />The intended design of the EGTS swap-over circuit was to detect an actual failure of the control <br />path in A-Auto and swap to the Standby control path. The unnecessary automatic swap to <br />Standby could prevent the EGTS train, configured in A-Auto, from performing its required safety <br />function during a DBE. On August 5, at 1658 eastern daylight time (EDT), the condition was <br />resolved when the automatic swap-over circuit was disabled. On August 17, at 1722 EDT a past <br />operability evaluation determined the configuration of the EGTS flow controllers constituted an <br />unanalyzed condition that significantly degraded plant safety due to the EGTS not meeting single <br />failure criteria. Engineering analysis determined that the failure of both trains of EGTS <br />controllers would not result in exceeding 10 CFR 100 limits. <br />An 8-hour non-emergency event notification (EN 52187) was made to the NRC in accordance <br />with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B), as an unanalyzed condition that significantly degraded plant <br />safety. This LER documents the reportable event under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B). <br />Additionally, this event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as any operation or condition <br />which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications (TS) when it was determined that <br />the Conditions and Required Actions of TS 3.6.10 would not have been met because this <br />condition has existed since initial plant startup. This event is also reportable under <br />10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v) as an event or condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety <br />function of structures or systems that are needed to: (C) control the release of radioactive <br />material and (D) mitigate the consequences of an accident. <br />B. Status of structures, components, or systems that were inoperable at the start of the event <br />and contributed to the event: <br />No inoperable structures, components, or systems contributed to this event. <br />Page 2 of 6 <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />1.

Dates and approximate times of occurrences: <br />Date/Time (EDT) Description <br />08/02/16 Engineering discovered that the EGTS may automatically swap from the <br />flow control path in A-Auto to the Standby flow control path upon the start <br />of a DBE. <br />08/05/16, 0723 Operations declared B train of the EGTS inoperable for both units based <br />on completion of a prompt determination of operability. Both units entered <br />Condition A of TS 3.6.10 with the time of entry declared to be <br />August 2, 2016, at 1647. <br />08/06/16, 0348 B train of the EGTS for Unit 2 was declared operable due to <br />implementation of a temporary modification that disabled the swap-over <br />logic. Concurrently, the Unit 2, A train EGTS dampers were declared <br />non-functional. A train of the EGTS for Unit 2 was declared inoperable <br />and Unit 2 entered Condition A of TS 3.6.10. <br />08/06/16, 0355 B train of the EGTS for Unit 1 was declared operable due to <br />implementation of a temporary modification that disabled the swap-over <br />logic. Concurrently, the Unit 1, A train EGTS dampers were declared <br />non-functional. A train of the EGTS for Unit 1 was declared inoperable <br />and Unit 1 entered Condition A of TS 3.6.10. <br />08/06/16, 0408 Both trains of the EGTS were declared operable for both units based on <br />both units' A and B train EGTS controllers isolation dampers being placed <br />in A-Auto with the swap-over logic disabled. Both units exited Condition A <br />of TS 3.6.10. <br />08/17/16, 1722 A past operability evaluation determined the configuration of the EGTS <br />flow controllers constituted an unanalyzed condition that significantly <br />degraded plant safety due to the EGTS not meeting single failure criteria. <br />08/17/16, 1746 An 8-hour non-emergency event notification (EN 52187) was made to the <br />NRC in accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B), as an unanalyzed <br />condition that significantly degraded plant safety. <br />D. Manufacturer and model number of each component that failed during the event: <br />There was no component that failed during the event. <br />E.

Method of discovery of each component or system failure or procedural error: <br />Engineering was reviewing circuits associated with the EGTS and discovered the issue. <br />G. The failure mode, mechanism, and effect of each failed component, if known: <br />There was no component that failed during the event. <br />H. Operator actions: <br />Following review and concurrence of a prompt determination of operability, the B train of EGTS <br />was declared inoperable for both units and both units entered TS 3.6.10 Condition A. <br />I. Automatically and manually initiated safety system responses: <br />There were no automatic or manual system responses associated with this event. <br />III. CAUSE OF THE EVENT <br />A. The cause of each component or system failure or personnel error, if known: <br />There was no component or system failure associated with this event. <br />The apparent cause was that the EGTS control circuitry was not designed to account for <br />situations that should have been anticipated. The cause relates to the original design of the <br />EGTS, and no current operational or programmatic weaknesses were identified. <br />B. The cause(s) and circumstances for each human performance related root cause: <br />There was no identified human performance related root cause. <br />IV. 	 ANALYSIS OF THE EVENT <br />The design bases for the EGTS are (1) to keep the air pressure within each Shield Building annulus <br />below atmospheric at all times in which the integrity of that particular containment is required, and (2) <br />to reduce the concentration of radioactive nuclides in annulus air that is released to the environs <br />during a loss of coolant accident (LOCA) in either reactor unit to levels sufficiently low to keep the <br />exclusion area boundary dose rate below the 10 CFR 100 guideline value. <br />The EGTS circuit contains four pressure switches [EMS: PS] designed to cause an automatic swap <br />over if the annulus pressure increases more positive than the pressure switch setpoint. These <br />switches are in the EGTS circuit to detect a suspected control function failure, and upon actuation, <br />result in the isolation of the A-Auto flow control path and automatically swap to the Standby flow <br />control path. With one flow path in A-Auto, and EGTS swapping to a failed opposite train due to a <br />DBE, neither train would be available for the event. <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />1. FACILITY NAME 6. LER NUMBER 2. DOCKET <br />Sequoyah Nuclear Plant Unit 1 05000327 <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER YEAR <br />REV <br />NO. <br />2016 - 007 	 00 <br />Page 5 of 6 <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) 	 LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />NARRATIVE <br />Engineering determined that there are three plausible scenarios in which the EGTS would not <br />perform as designed during a DBE which could result in the EGTS not fulfilling its required safety <br />function. The three scenarios are a large or small break LOCA and a Phase A signal received while <br />either unit's annulus is at atmospheric pressure. For each of the three scenarios, coincident with an <br />assumed loss of one train of control air, the EGTS would swap to an isolated Standby flow path, <br />which would result in both of the EGTS fans not having an exhaust path. The EGTS would not be <br />able to pull a vacuum in the annulus, resulting in the annulus pressure becoming positive. This could <br />result in a continuous, unmonitored release to the environment. <br />V. 	 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES <br />The SQN probabilistic risk assessment model does not consider EGTS in core damage and <br />large early release frequencies. Engineering analysis determined that the failure of both trains <br />of EGTS controllers could have resulted in a more than minimal increase in dose associated <br />with the current dose analysis; however the dose would have remained below 10 CFR 100 <br />limits. <br />A. Availability of systems or components that could have performed the same function as the <br />components and systems that failed during the event: <br />There were no components or systems that failed during the event. <br />B. For events that occurred when the reactor was shut down, availability of systems or <br />components needed to shutdown the reactor and maintain safe shutdown conditions, <br />remove residual heat, control the release of radioactive material, or mitigate the <br />consequences of an accident: <br />The event did not occur when the reactor was shutdown. <br />C. For failure that rendered a train of a safety system inoperable, an estimate of the elapsed <br />time from discovery of the failure until the train was returned to service: <br />The B train of the EGTS for Unit 2 was inoperable for approximately 83 hours. The B train of the <br />EGTS for Unit 1 was inoperable for approximately 83.2 hours. <br />VI. 	 CORRECTIVE ACTIONS <br />This event was entered into the Tennessee Valley Authority Corrective Action Program under <br />Condition Reports (CR) 1198440 and 1200028. <br />A. 	 Immediate Corrective Actions: <br />Engineering notified the appropriate individuals and Operations requested a prompt <br />determination of operability evaluation. The condition was resolved when the automatic <br />swap-over circuit was disabled. <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />1. FACILITY NAME 6. LER NUMBER 2.

Corrective actions to reduce probability of similar events occurring in the future: <br />Corrective actions include implementing a permanent modification to disable the EGTS <br />automatic swap-over function. <br />VII. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION <br />A. Previous similar events at the same plant: <br />A review of SQN LERs identified an event with a similar cause. LER 327/2013-003 reported a <br />condition prohibited by technical specifications associated with the Emergency Core Cooling <br />System. The cause of the event was the conduit penetrations for the residual heat removal <br />containment sump isolation valve were not designed to account for groundwater infiltration <br />through the plant concrete structures resulting in leakage into the conduit and subsequently the <br />limit switch compartment. <br />B. Additional Information: <br />None. <br />C. Safety System Functional Failure Consideration: <br />This condition resulted in a safety system functional failure. <br />D.
