PAGE <br />Salem Generating Station — Unit 2 <br />YEAR SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />REVISION <br />NUMBER <br />3 OF 4 05000311 <br />2016 <br />	 - 005 	 - 000 <br />CAUSE OF EVENT <br />The direct cause for Salem Unit 2 turbine generator trip was an intermittent ground fault caused by a <br />broken Current Transformer (CT) core ground wire that was intermittently touching the low voltage <br />connections inside the transformer bushing compartment. <br />The exact cause for the broken wire has not yet been determined yet. A Root Cause Evaluation is <br />currently in progress. The preliminary report found that the CT wires were not secured to the transformer <br />tank as expected. <br />SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS <br />There were no safety consequences as a result of this event. Operators appropriately responded to the reactor <br />trip to stabilize the plant. All emergency core cooling systems and emergency safeguards feature systems <br />functioned as expected. The motor driven and steam driven' auxiliary feedwater pumps started as <br />expected on steam generator low level. Operators stabilized .the plant in Mode 3 with decay heat <br />removal via the main steam dump valves and auxiliary feedwater system. Condenser vacuum remained <br />available for the duration of the event. <br />SAFETY SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL FAILURE <br />This condition did not result in a safety system functional failure as defined in NEI 99-02, Regulatory <br />Assessment Performance Indicator Guidelines. <br />PREVIOUS EVENTS <br />A review of previous events for the past three years identified two similar events. License Event Report <br />(LER) 272/2014-003-00, Reactor Trip Due to Actuation of Generator Protection was issued on June 4, <br />2014. License Event Report (LER) 272/2014-004-00, Reactor Trip Due to Actuation of Generator <br />Protection was issued on July 3, 2014. Both event were due to a failed wiring termination on the <br />C Phase neutral generator current transformer. The corrective actions taken for those events were <br />specific to them and would not have prevented this event. <br />CORRECTIVE ACTIONS <br />1. The broken CT wire on the A MPT was repaired. <br />2. The B and C MPT's were electrically tested with no anomalies noted. <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(02-2014) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 01/31/2017 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 <br />hours.
