The flow path was <br />promptly identified and isolated. A leak test was planned and performed at higher RCS pressure to <br />quantify the leakage. The seat leak test at normal operating pressure was halted when an appropriate <br />differential pressure was not achieved for testing. As a result, V3217, Safety Injection Loop 1A2 Check <br />Valve, was declared inoperable, and Unit 1' was placed in Mode 5 COLD SHUTDOWN to complete <br />repairs. The leakage past V3217 was caused by inadequate maintenance practices and procedures <br />that did not ensure V3217 was within acceptable tolerances and correctly assembled in 2013. <br />Cofrective actions inclUde revisions to procedures for check valve maintenance, check valve trending <br />and check valve preventive maintenance. <br />This event is reportable pursuant to.10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by Technical <br />Specifications. Since this condition was identified with Unit 1 in HOT STANDBY prior to reactor startup, <br />the leaking check valve had no direct nuclear safety significance or impact to the environment. <br />This event had no effect on the health and safety of the public. <br />NCR FORM 366 (06-2016) <br />YEAR SEQUENTIAL NUMBER <br />REVISION <br />NUMBER <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request 80 hours.

FACILITY NAME 6. LER NUMBER 2. DOCKET <br />05000335 St. Lucie Unit 1 <br />2016 - 	 002 - 	 00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />Description of the Event <br />On August 5, 2016, Unit 1 was in Mode 5 and in the process of restarting following a maintenance <br />outage. On August 5, 2016, Unit 1 entered Mode 4 at 0943, Operators were conducting activities to <br />cool down the shutdown cooling system after removing the system from service. With Unit 1 in <br />Mode 4, Operators observed the Reactor Coolant System (RCS) [AB] Pressurizer level lowering <br />when opening of HCV-3618, Safety Injection Loop 1A2 Check Valve Leakage Isolation Valve, as <br />part of the procedure for system restoration. Based on the lowering Pressurizer level, operators <br />closed HCV-3618. This action arrested the Pressurizer level reduction by isolating the internally <br />leaking check valve V3217 [ISV:AB] and stopping RCS leakage to the Refueling Water Tank (RN/VT). <br />The flow path was promptly identified and isolated prior to any alarms or automatic system <br />actuations. <br />Procedural guidance to quantify the seat leakage required establishing a differential pressure which <br />did not exist at current conditions. A seat leakage test was planned when RCS pressure could be <br />established to meet the required conditions. Unit 1 entered Mode 3 on August 6, 2016. On August <br />7, 2016 with the RCS at the normal operating pressure 2250 psia, test personnel were unable to <br />achieve an appropriate differential pressure to allow the performance of a seat leak test of V3217, <br />and the seat leak test was halted. <br />On August 7, 2016, at 1600, V3217 was declared inoperable, and Unit 1 entered The Technical <br />Specification action statement (TSAS) 3.4.6.2.e, RCS pressure isolation valve leakage. The action <br />statement required that leakage be reduced to within limits within 4 hours or be in at least HOT <br />STANDBY within 6 hours and in COLD SHUTDOWN within the following 30 hours. During the <br />allowed 4 hours, a second attempt was made to leak check V3217, but the required differential <br />pressure could not be achieved. <br />Unit 1 entered Mode 4 on August 8, 2016, at 0233, and entered Mode 5 on August 8, 2016, at 2003. <br />Unit 1 remained in Mode 5 until repairs to V3217 were completed. <br />Cause <br />The internal leakage past V3217 was caused by inadequate contractor maintenance practices and <br />procedures that did not ensure V3217 was within acceptable tolerances and correctly assembled. It <br />was identified that maintenance performed in 2013 incorrectly assembled internal valve bushings, <br />and bushing spacers were not installed per the design. This resulted in excessive internal wear and <br />misalignment. <br />A second root cause identified that V3217 is susceptible to accelerated wear if differential pressure <br />is not maintained across the seat. This was not recognized and incorporated into the overall valve <br />maintenance strategy. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) <br />	 Page 2 of 4 <br />1. FACILITY NAME 6. LER NUMBER - 2.

If a means used to impose an information collection does not display a currently <br />valid OMB control number, the NRC may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, the <br />information collection. <br />NARRATIVE <br />Analysis of the Event <br />The increased internal leakage past V3217 resulted in the RCS pressure isolation valve initially <br />being declared inoperable on August 7, 2016 at 1600. Since the internal seat leakage was not <br />reduced to within limits, Technical Specifications allow 40 hours for the Unit to be in Mode 5, COLD <br />SHUTDOWN. As a result of the internal inspection and known operational at-power conditions, the <br />period of concern was from the initial achievement of Mode 4 on August 5, 2016 at 0943 to the <br />declaration of entry into the Technical Specification action statement and entry into Mode 5 on <br />August 8, 2016 at 2003. This time period exceeded the allowed 40 hours, making this event <br />reportable pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), Operation or Condition Prohibited by Technical <br />Specifications. <br />As a result of internal leakage with V3217, the upstream Safety Injection piping had been <br />maintained near RCS system pressures for the majority of the SL1-25 and SL1-26 operating cycles, <br />but had been successfully tested during each cycle with less than 1 gpm leakage prior to the <br />maintenance outage. FPL performed an internal valve inspection after the unsuccessful test <br />following a maintenance outage. kreview of previous valve maintenance and testing history <br />concluded that cumulative internal valve wear had occurred within the valve due in part to <br />inadequate assembly tolerances introduced in 2013 and a lack of differential pressure. This wear <br />was sufficient to cause acceptable leakage up to the point where the last forward flow through the <br />valve was established with shutdown cooling flow, on August 5, 2016 during a plant shutdown for <br />maintenance. Cumulatively, the disc seat wear and increased clearances allowed the disc to <br />progressively move lower in the valve seat until shutdown cooling flow moved the disc off its <br />remaining seat. The disc inside the seating surface is convex in shape. This convex shape would <br />help to keep the disc seated until the valve was opened by flow. The flow induced opening of the <br />disc caused the disc to drop due to the cumulative wear of the internal parts. The disc seating <br />surface and the valve body seating surface did not subsequently align resulting in leakage <br />exceeding Technical Specification limits. <br />Safety Significance <br />This condition was mitigated by the downstream RCS pressure isolation valves in series with V3217 <br />satisfactorily performing their isolation function during the period described. <br />Safety injection system pressure isolation check valves leakage of reactor coolant through the <br />safety injection system isolation check valves (V3217, V3227, V3237 and V3247) can be detected <br />by an associated pressure increase on the low pressure side of the check valves. Pressure <br />indicator alarm instruments (PIA-3319, 3329, 3339 and 3349) on the control board monitor system <br />pressure. Safety injection system isolation check valves outside the containment (V3113, V3114, <br />V3123, V3124, V3133, V3134, V3143 and V3144) are also periodically tested in accordance with <br />the plant Technical Specifications, in order to reduce the probability of reactor coolant system <br />leakage into the high and low pressure safety injection system pipe lines. These valves are within <br />the scope of Generic Letter 87-06, "Periodic Verification of Leak Tight Integrity of Pressure Isolation <br />Valves." <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) <br />	 Page 3 of 4 <br />1.

Therefore, it is concluded that the risk <br />impact of the stated event is not risk-significant. The reactor remained shut down during the period <br />of concern. V3217 is one of four different piping branches for Safety Injection. Internal valve <br />leakage does not impact this safety function. Redundant, in-series check valves to V3217 remained <br />operable during the period of concern. Given the short period where Technical Specification time <br />limits were exceeded, the health and safety of the public were not affected by this event. <br />Immediate Corrective Actions <br />V3217 was disassembled and repaired prior to unit restart using improved procedure guidance and <br />vendor input. New components were installed including the valve disc, hinge pins, bushings and <br />gaskets. The valve body seat was refurbished. A post maintenance test indicated zero leakage. <br />Corrective Actions to Prevent Recurrence <br />The corrective actions listed below have been entered into the site corrective action program. Any <br />changes to the actions will be managed under the corrective action program. <br />1. New time based preventive maintenance is being developed for safety injection loop <br />pressure isolation valves consistent with EPRI PMB Guidance for Critical, Low duty cycle, <br />Mild service (CLM) check valves. <br />2. The Maintenance Strategy for safety injection loop pressure isolation valves is being revised <br />to reflect that mild service condition requires the valve to be closed with differential pressure. <br />3. The station's maintenance procedure for Atwood-Morrill swing check valves is being revised <br />to incorporate industry best practices described in the EPRI Check Value Maintenance Guide <br />for assembly procedures (section 5.1.3 of EPRI Guide), seat inspection (section 7.4.7 of <br />EPRI Guide), excessive clearance checks (section 7.4.8 of EPRI Guide) and refurbishment <br />(section 7.4.9 of EPRI Guide). <br />Failed Component <br />Unit 1 V3217 is an Atwood & Morrill Company, 12-inch, swinging disc, inclined seat type check <br />valve. <br />Manufacturer <br />Atwood & Morrill Company <br />Previous Occurrence <br />No previous similar LERs. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) <br />	 Page 4 of 4<br /></span>
