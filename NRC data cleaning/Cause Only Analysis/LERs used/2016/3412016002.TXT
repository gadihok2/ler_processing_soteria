EXPECTED 	 MONTH 	 DAY 	 YEAR <br />SUBMISSION <br />DATE <br />ABSTRACT (Limit to 1400 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten fines) <br />On January 22, 2016, at 1923 EST, both divisions of the Residual Heat Removal (RHR) system were declared inoperable for the Low <br />Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI) mode of operation due to a failure of the division 1 LPCI outboard injection motor operated valve <br />(MOV), El 1 50F017A. While performing the division 1 RHR pump and valve operability surveillance test, E1150F017A closed <br />properly but failed to open during its required stroke time test. With this valve closed and unable to automatically open, LPCI injection <br />into the Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) from both divisions of RHR would be prevented if the LPCI loop select logic selected the <br />division 1 recirculation loop for injection; therefore, this failure rendered both divisions of RHR inoperable for the LPCI function. <br />Technical Specification limiting condition for operation (LCO) 3.5.1, Condition K, was entered, which requires immediate entry into <br />LCO 3.0.3. The cause of the failure was subsequently identified as a foreign material (screw) that affected the function of the MOV <br />contactor. The root cause was determined to be less than adequate inspection procedures and susceptibility of the contactor to foreign <br />material. Inspection of all other susceptible equipment is ongoing to tighten loose screws and a modification is planned to install <br />Foreign Material Exclusion (FME) barriers. <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />1. FACILITY NAME <br />05000- <br />2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LER NUMBER <br />Fermi 2 341 <br />YEAR SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />REV <br />NO. <br />2016 002 00 <br />Initial Plant Conditions: <br />Mode 1 <br />Reactor Power 100 percent <br />There were no inoperable Structures, Systems, or Components at the start of the event that contributed to the <br />event. <br />Description of the Event <br />On January 22, 2016, at 1923 EST, both divisions of Residual Heat Removal (RHR) [BO] were declared <br />inoperable for the Low Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI) mode of operation due to a failure of the division 1 <br />LPCI outboard injection motor operated valve [ISV], El 1 50F017A. While performing the division 1 RHR pump <br />and valve operability surveillance test, El 150F017A closed properly but failed to open during its required stroke <br />time test. <br />The Fermi 2 accident analysis takes credit for the proper operation of the LPCI loop select logic during a loss of <br />coolant accident (LOCA). The loss of coolant event involves the postulation of a spectrum of piping breaks <br />inside the primary containment, varying in size, type, and location. The most severe nuclear system effects and <br />the greatest release of material to the primary containment result from a complete circumferential break of one of <br />the two reactor recirculation loop [AD] pipe lines. This is the design basis accident (DBA). Since the LPCI <br />system injects water into the reactor vessel [RPV] through the discharge piping of one of the recirculation loops, <br />a loop selection logic is provided to ensure that the water is injected into an unbroken loop. The loop selection <br />logic compares pressure on the two recirculation loops. A broken loop will indicate a lower pressure than an <br />unbroken loop. The loop selection logic directs the LPCI injection into the high pressure (unbroken) loop. The <br />loop selection is effected through the operation of the RHR injection valves. <br />Valve E1150F017A is a normally open RHR injection valve in series with the inboard El 1 50F015A valve. <br />These valves control the RHR LPCI flow into reactor recirculation loop A. Because the valve failed in the closed <br />position, flow would be inhibited into the A recirculation loop for scenarios where a break is detected in loop B. <br />Therefore, both divisions of RHR were declared inoperable for the LPCI function at 1923 EST on January 22, <br />2016. Technical Specification 3.5.1, Condition K was invoked and limiting condition for operation (LCO) 3.0.3 <br />was immediately entered. <br />Trouble shooting determined that the control power [JS] closing contactor did not have full freedom of <br />movement because of foreign material. The contactor was removed from the Motor Control Center (MCC) and <br />was manually cycled on a workbench. While manually cycling the contactor, a screw fell out of the contactor. <br />The screw apparently fell into the contactor from a Control Relay (CR) located above the contactor in the MCC. <br />At approximately 2143 EST, the El 150F017A valve was re-tested satisfactorily. The valve properly closed and <br />opened, meeting required Inservice Inspection (ISI) stroke time acceptance criteria. At 2145 EST, both divisions <br />of RHR were declared operable for the LPCI and LCO 3.5.1, Condition K and. LCO 3.0.3 were exited. <br />Page 2 of 4 <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />Page 3 of 4 <br />    <br />JIDPSAIrtate 	 881.330s 	<br /> <br />     <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(11-2015) <br />  <br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />1.

LER NUMBER <br />Fermi 2 341 <br />YEAR SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />REV <br />NO. <br />2016 002 00 <br />An 8 hour event notification number 51676 was made pursuant to 10CFR50.72(b)(3)(v)(D) on <br />January 23, 2016, 0020 EST, to the NRC Operations Center. Reactor Power was maintained at 100 percent <br />throughout the event. <br />This report is being made pursuant to I OCFR50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) as a condition that could have prevented the <br />fulfillment of a system safety function needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. In addition, this <br />report is being made pursuant to 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(vii) as an event where a single cause or condition caused at <br />least one independent train or channel to become inoperable in multiple systems or two independent trains or <br />channels to become inoperable in a single system designed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. <br />Significant Safety Consequences and Implications  <br />The safety function of the LPCI mode of the RHR system is to inject water from the suppression pool into the <br />reactor vessel via injection lines connected to the reactor recirculation piping following a large break LOCA. <br />Since a large break LOCA could occur in either one of the two reactor recirculation loops, the LPCI loop select <br />logic function is designed to select the undamaged reactor recirculation loop for LPCI injection. Under the <br />conditions of this event, with the Loop A outboard injection valve closed and unable to open, had a LOCA <br />occurred in recirculation loop B or elsewhere in the reactor connected piping systems in containment, the <br />automatic LPCI injection to the reactor vessel would have been prevented. <br />Inoperability of the E1150FO1 7A valve, for approximately one hour and 50 minutes, rendered both divisions of <br />LPCI inoperable. However, during that period of time the core spray and standby feedwater systems were <br />available to address large break LOCA events. The high pressure coolant injection, reactor core isolation <br />cooling, and standby feedwater systems were also available to address any small break LOCA scenarios that <br />could have occurred at that time. The event was of low safety significance considering the short duration; <br />therefore, the health and safety of the general public were not adversely <br />impacted. <br />Cause of the Event <br />A Root Cause Evaluation determined that the technical requirements to check all fasteners for looseness were not <br />adequately implemented into Maintenance work instructions (procedures) for MCC inspections during <br />Preventative Maintenance. Additionally, the General Electric (GE) CR305 contactor orientation inside the MCC <br />created a susceptibility to foreign material. When the contactor is mounted horizontally, an opening is created <br />where foreign material can fall into the contactor. <br />The contributing cause was that previous Corrective Action Program documents/products did not <br />adequately identify the cause of similar previous events and did not effectively implement corrective actions to <br />minimize recurrence. <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />Page 4 of 4 <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />1. FACILITY NAME <br />05000- <br />2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LER NUMBER <br />Fermi 2 341 <br />YEAR SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />REV <br />NO. <br />2016 002 00 <br />Corrective Actions <br />The foreign material was removed and the MCC bucket was restored and tested satisfactorily. The MCC was <br />independently inspected for additional foreign material and all other screws on the relay were tightened. Four <br />procedures will be revised to include instructions to check accessible spare terminal screws for tightness. The <br />revisions will be complete by May 31, 2016. <br />Additional corrective actions include personnel training and the inspection of Engineered Safety Feature (ESF) <br />MCC positions with CR120B relays for loose or missing screws and for susceptible contactor orientation. All <br />screws will be tightened during the inspections and a Design Change will be implemented to modify the <br />susceptible MCC contactors with a permanent FME barrier. Initial visual inspections are complete. All <br />corrective actions will be completed by the next refueling outage (RF18), scheduled for spring 2017. <br />Additional Information:  <br />A. Failed Component Data: <br />None. <br />B. Previous Similar Events: <br />LER 2005-004, "Both Residual Heat Removal Low Pressure Coolant Injection Divisions <br />Inoperable Due to Valve Failure," was submitted when the E1150F017B, the Division 2 <br />LPCI outboard injection valve, failed to open. The cause of the failure was high resistance <br />on the open contactor auxiliary interlock contact. Therefore, the corrective actions for LER <br />2005-004 would not have prevented the current event. <br />Actions taken in response to Condition Assessment Resolution Document 06-22311, <br />which identified a foreign material that impacted the operation of a similar contactor were not <br />effective to prevent the occurrence of this event. <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015)<br /></span>
