The maximum SC pressure observed was <br />approximately 0.120 inches of vacuum water column. The TS requirement is to maintain SC vacuum greater than or equal to 0.125 <br />inches of vacuum water column for SC operability. All plant equipment responded as required to the changing conditions and <br />RBHVAC and SGTS already in operation returned the SC pressure to within the TS limits; therefore, the Limiting Condition for <br />Operation was met. There were no safety consequences or radiological releases associated with this event. <br />The cause of this momentary loss of SC was determined to be the combined effect of the RBHVAC startup sequence with high winds <br />outside the Reactor Building (RB). For corrective actions, Fermi 2 has implemented a plant modification to the RBHVAC system to <br />improve its ability to maintain RB pressure negative during the RBHVAC startup sequence. In addition, Fermi 2 will adopt Technical <br />Specification Task Force Traveler (TSTF) 551, "Revise Secondary Containment Surveillance Requirements," when it is approved, to <br />eliminate the need to declare SC inoperable due to momentarily exceeding the TS vacuum limit. <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016) <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(06-2016) <br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.govireading-rm/doc-collectionsinuregs/staff/sr1022/13/)  <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

The maximum SC pressure observed during the event was approximately 0.120 inches of <br />vacuum water column. In addition to the restart of RBHVAC, high winds were noted at the time that SC was lost. <br />There are two recorder [[PR]] divisions to monitor SC pressure. The Division 2 recorder indicated 0.120 inches of vacuum <br />water column. The Division 1 recorder indication was within TS limits throughout this event, with a maximum SC pressure <br />of 0.150 inches of vacuum water column. SC pressure was immediately returned to within the TS limit by RBHVAC and <br />SGTS already in operation. There were no equipment failures or abnormal equipment indications observed during the <br />RBHVAC startup sequence. There were no radiological releases associated with this event. <br />The TS requirement is to maintain secondary containment vacuum greater than or equal to 0.125 inches of vacuum water <br />column (TS Surveillance Requirement 3.6.4.1.1) for SC operability. <br />An 8-hour event notification (EN 52146) was made to the NRC based on meeting the reporting criteria of Title 10 Code of <br />Federal Regulations (10 CFR) 50.72(b)(3)(v)(C) as an event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of a <br />safety function needed to control the release of radioactive material. This Licensee Event Report (LER) is being made <br />under the corresponding requirement in 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(C). <br />SIGNIFICANT SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS: <br />There were no safety consequences or radiological releases associated with this event. At no time during this event was <br />there a potential for endangering the public health and safety. <br />The specified safety function of the SC is to contain, dilute, and hold up fission products that may leak from primary <br />containment following a Design Basis Accident (DBA). In conjunction with operation of the SGTS and closure of certain <br />valves [[V]] whose lines penetrate the SC, the SC is designed to reduce the activity level of the fission products prior to <br />release to the environment and to isolate and contain fission products that are released during certain operations that take <br />place inside primary containment, when primary containment is not required to be OPERABLE, or that take place outside <br />primary containment. It is possible for the pressure in the control volume to rise relative to the environmental pressure <br />(e.g., due to pump [[P]] and motor [[MO]] heat load additions). To prevent ground level exfiltration while allowing the SC to <br />be designed as a conventional structure, the SC requires support systems to maintain the control volume pressure at less <br />than the external pressure. For the SC to be considered OPERABLE, it must have adequate leak tightness to ensure that <br />the required vacuum can be established and maintained. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 	 2 	 of 	 5 <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />	<br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(06-2016) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1022/r3/)  <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

LER NUMBER  <br />Fermi 2 341 <br />YEAR SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />REV <br />NO. <br />2016 005 00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />During this particular event, a higher indicated SC pressure was recorded for a total of approximately 1 second. In <br />Chapter 15 of the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR), RBHVAC is assumed lost at the onset of a Loss of <br />Coolant Accident (LOCA) concurrent with a Loss of Offsite Power. As a result, calculations show that the SC would be <br />pressurized until the SGTS restores vacuum. For this event, the structural integrity (i.e., leak tightness) of the SC was re-<br />confirmed when RBHVAC and SGTS restored pressure to less than -0.125 inches water column. <br />If the DBA LOCA for SC concurrent with a Loss of Offsite Power had occurred during the time when the SC pressure TS <br />limit was exceeded, the SC was sufficiently leak tight such that the SGTS would still have established and maintained <br />vacuum greater than the TS required value. <br />The radiological consequences of the DBA LOCA for SC contained in Chapter 15 of the Fermi 2 UFSAR result in doses <br />that are below 10 CFR 50.67. The SC is assumed to be at a pressure of -0.125 inches water column at the onset of the <br />LOCA. For this particular event, had the DBA LOCA for SC actually occurred, the increase in magnitude of radiological <br />dose as a result of increased draw-down time from the highest recorded pressure of -0.120 vice -0.125 inches water <br />column for 1 second, would be minimal and negated by several very conservative assumptions in the existing analysis <br />(e.g., 100% exfiltration from SC during the first 15 minutes of drawdown with SGTS in operation, 10% exfiltration from SC <br />with SGTS in operation throughout the remaining 30 day duration of the accident, no holdup time in SC throughout the 30 <br />day duration of the accident, and all exfiltration and filtered releases are at ground level). <br />CAUSE OF THE EVENT: <br />The combined effect of the RBHVAC startup sequence with high winds caused the momentary loss of SC. <br />Depending on the exact exhaust fan and supply fan start relay timing, SC pressure can increase during RBHVAC startup, <br />which reduces the margin to the TS limit. During RBHVAC startup, the exhaust fan starts prior to the intake fan. Then the <br />respective dampers open in the same order to maintain a negative pressure in the Reactor Building (RB) [[NG]]. The <br />modulating vane dampers modulate to control building air pressure through the start process. There is a timer delay of 2 <br />seconds between the start of the exhaust fan and intake fan. The time delay relays [[62]] functioned as intended during <br />this event. However, it has been previously identified that a longer timer delay would improve the system's ability to <br />maintain RB pressure and preserve margin to the TS limit. <br />In addition, high winds outside the RB are known to cause large and rapid changes in RB differential pressure (i.e. <br />between inside and outside the RB). There are two divisions to monitor SC pressure. Each division has four pressure <br />transmitters [[PT]] located on the RB fifth floor, one on each of the four RB walls, with a pressure probe that penetrates the <br />wall to the outside, and a recorder. The recorder indicates the highest pressure of the four inputs from the transmitters. <br />Using the equation provided in Section 6.2 of the Fermi 2 UFSAR, wind speeds of 30 to 60 miles per hour (mph) on the <br />RB result in an external pressure change of -0.27 to 1.07 inches water column on the leeward side of the building. The <br />negative change on the leeward side of the building results in a lower RB differential pressure. As a result, high wind <br />gusts are sufficient to cause momentary loss of SC even with no other contributing causes. Data from the time of the <br />event indicates an average wind speed of approximately 9 mph. Although no specific data on the magnitude of wind gusts <br />is available at the time of the event (i.e. showing instantaneous wind speeds greater than 9 mph), it is expected that the <br />wind speed at the time of the event affected the indicated RB differential pressure. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page <br />	 3 	 of 	 5 <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(06-2016) <br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1022/r3/)  <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

LER NUMBER <br />Fermi 2 341 <br />YEAR SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />REV <br />NO. <br />2016 005 00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: <br />No corrective actions were required to restore compliance with the TS requirement. <br />A plant modification was previously planned to increase the time delay between the start of the exhaust fan and the intake <br />fan. This modification will improve the system's ability to maintain RB pressure negative during the RBHVAC startup <br />sequence and will thus preserve margin to the TS limit. This modification was completed on September 14, 2016. This <br />modification addresses the first contributing cause discussed above. <br />In addition, Fermi 2 will adopt Technical Specification Task Force Traveler (TSTF) 551, "Revise Secondary Containment <br />Surveillance Requirements," when it is approved by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. This TSTF would eliminate <br />the need to declare SC inoperable due to momentarily exceeding the TS vacuum limit, such as may be caused by wind <br />gusts and maintenance, testing, or swapping the normal ventilation subsystems. <br />Additional corrective actions will be evaluated and tracked in the Corrective Action Program (CAP). <br />PREVIOUS OCCURRENCES: <br />As described above, the SC pressure increase during the RBHVAC system startup sequence contributed to the cause of <br />this event. Similar events involving loss of SC due to the RBHVAC system have been reported in the following LERs: <br />LER 2013-001 involved a loss of SC function due to an RBHVAC system equipment malfunction. The cause of that event <br />was related to improper damper sequencing. <br />LER 2013-003 involved a loss of SC function due to an RBHVAC system equipment malfunction. The cause of that event <br />was related to a RBHVAC system trip caused by the lack of steam flow through a heating coil due to inadequate draining <br />of the downstream steam trap. <br />LER 2015-001 involved the loss of SC function due to an RBHVAC system trip caused by a valid actuation of a freeze <br />protection device. <br />LER 2015-004 involved the loss of SC function due to reverse rotation of the RBHVAC center exhaust fan during post-<br />maintenance testing caused by reversed electrical leads. <br />LER 2015-005-01 involved the loss of SC function due to setpoint drift of the RBHVAC supply damper time delay relay <br />resulting in the dampers moving out of sequence. <br />Although the events above are similar, they do not involve the same underlying concern or reason as this event, such as <br />the same cause, failure, or sequence of events. In particular, the August 2, 2016 event reported in this LER did not <br />involve a trip of RBHVAC and did not identify any equipment failures or abnormal equipment indications in the RBHVAC <br />system. However, corrective actions in response to LER 2013-001 included the plant modification to increase the time <br />delay between the start of the exhaust fan and the intake fan for the RBHVAC system, which is expected to improve the <br />performance of the system during startup. This plant modification, although complete now, had not yet been implemented <br />at the time that this event occurred and was therefore not able to prevent occurrence of this event. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 	 4 	 of 	 5 <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(06-2016) <br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) Page 5 of 	 5 <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1022/r3/)   <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.
