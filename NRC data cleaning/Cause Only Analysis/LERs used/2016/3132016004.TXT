The consequence of the <br />leak was that both trains of the DHR system were declared inoperable. <br />The leakage was due to a fatigue crack caused by vibration of the drain line due to a pipe support that was not <br />designed for system vibration. <br />Other systems and components in ANO-1 and ANO, Unit 2 (ANO-2) exposed to elevated system vibration were <br />evaluated with respect to this condition. As a result of this evaluation, socket welds on other drains and vents in the <br />ANO-1 DHR system were cut out and replaced, and pipe supports were modified where needed to withstand system <br />vibration. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) <br />1.

Plant Status <br />At the time this condition was identified, ANO-1 was shut down and in a refueling outage with the core fully loaded. <br />No structures, systems, or components were out of service at the time of this event that contributed to this event. <br />B. Event Description <br />At approximately 20:47 on September 29, 2016, the ANO-1 Control Room received a report of a leak in the ANO-1 <br />Reactor Building (RB). Investigation revealed a 0.125 gpm leak in a class 1 pipe from a socket weld [VTV] where <br />the drain pipe connects to the main DHR system injection line. This leak was on a section of cross-connect piping <br />shared by both trains of the DHR system. <br />Operations closed RB penetrations providing direct access from the RB atmosphere to the outside atmosphere in <br />accordance with required actions of DHR Technical Specification (TS) 3.9.5. <br />To reduce the potential for propagation of the weld crack, Operations maintained DHR flow at less than 2000 gpm <br />and monitored data from vibration probes affixed to the affected piping to maintain low vibration levels. <br />To remove the reliance on the DHR system, actions were taken to defuel the reactor vessel, which was <br />accomplished at 12:00 on Thursday, October 6, 2016. The leak remained less than or equal to 0.125 gpm from <br />the time of discovery until the piping was removed from service for repair. <br />C. Background — System Design <br />The DHR /Low Pressure Injection (LPI) [BP] pumps have three major functions. The first is to remove decay heat <br />from the fuel and Reactor Coolant System (RCS) once the plant is shut down and cooled down. To do this, the <br />DHR pump takes suction from the RCS, discharges through a cooler which is cooled by Service Water, and injects <br />the cooled water back into the RCS. A second function is to provide required net positive suction head from the <br />RB Sump to the High Pressure Injection (HP1) pumps in the event of an intermediate size loss-of-coolant accident <br />(LOCA). The third function is LPI of borated water from the Borated Water Storage Tank or RB Sump into the RCS <br />in the event of a large-break LOCA or after cooling down and depressurizing sufficiently following an intermediate <br />break LOCA. <br />D. Event Cause <br />This condition was self-revealing. The direct cause of the leak was a fatigue crack caused by vibration of the drain. <br />ANO's corrective actions for previous DHR/LPI system drain line socket weld cracks did not either adequately <br />address worst case operating conditions or eliminate the source of the vibration. In addition, the DHR operating <br />procedure contained inadequate administrative barriers to minimize DHR system vibration. Furthermore, previous <br />corrective actions did not ensure that Operations training programs were updated regarding the basis for limiting <br />DHR system flow to minimize system vibration. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 2 of 4 <br />NRC FORM 366 <br />(06-2016) <br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: <br />10/31/2018 <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />(See Page 2 for required number of digits/characters for each block) <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.govireading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/srl0221r31)  <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours. <br />Reported lessons learned are incorporated into the licensing process and fed back to industry. <br />Send comments regarding burden estimate to the FOIA, Privacy and Information Collections <br />Branch (T-5 F53), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, or by e-mail <br />to Infocollects.Resource@nrc.gov, and to the Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory <br />Affairs, NEOB-10202, (3150-0104), Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.

The drain line socket welds were replaced with enhanced welds. The <br />tie-back supports for DH-1037 and DH-1450 were designed using as-measured vibration spectra to provide <br />hardening against system vibration. The evaluation of other systems and components identified no additional <br />corrective actions for vibration-induced damage. <br />E. 	 Corrective Actions <br />The corrective actions taken and planned are: <br />• The cracked socket weld was repaired. The tie-back drain line support was redesigned and replaced. This <br />hardens the system against vibration-induced fatigue cracking and component damage. <br />• The DHR system piping and supports inside the RB were inspected for damage. No other damage was <br />identified. The stresses on the DHR system one-inch drain line isolation valves inside the RB were <br />calculated using as-measured response spectra to ensure acceptable performance. The socket welds for <br />several other drain valves were cut out and replaced using enhanced welds. <br />• Post-modification testing of the drain valve and support modifications confirmed that the corrective actions <br />would result in acceptable vibration of the drain lines during high system flow rates. <br />• The DHR operating procedure is planned to be revised to provide specific administrative guidance to <br />minimize DHR system vibration, consistent with results of post-modification testing. <br />F. 	 Safety Significant Evaluation <br />For the function of the DHR system, the effect of the one-inch drain line completely separating from the eight-inch <br />Core Flood Tank injection line is estimated to be a leak of 98 gpm with the backpressure that would exist at 4,000 <br />gpm of DHR system flow. When the leak was discovered, both DHR pumps were in service. The second DHR <br />pump was secured and the remaining pump flow was throttled back to approximately 2000 gpm (2000 gpm is <br />adequate for core cooling at all expected decay heat levels). The maximum flow that can be provided by a <br />DHR/LPI pump is 3547 gpm per CALC-92-E-0077-08. Therefore, the potential loss of approximately 175 gpm <br />through the leak path would not have prevented either DHR train from providing adequate core cooling. <br />For the function of piggyback operation (suction from RB Sump through LPI Pump to HPI pump) the HPI pump has <br />a maximum flowrate of approximately 525 gpm. Considering the aforementioned LPI flow capability, complete <br />separation of the one-inch drain line would not have prevented the HPI pump from performing its specified safety <br />function. <br />In the LPI mode of operation following a trip from full power, the mechanism which caused the flow-induced <br />vibration fatigue failure would not have occurred until RCS pressure had lowered to approximately 30 psig. This is <br />because venturi cavitation does not occur until the pressure downstream of the venturis reaches approximately 30 <br />psig. The extent-of-condition review identified three drains that were susceptible to this vibration-induced fatigue <br />failure. The total loss of the three drains equates to an area of about 1.56 sq. inches, which is bounded by <br />supporting LOCA calculations. A review of the associated pump curves indicated that there is more than enough <br />margin to account for the losses through the drain lines assuming these two failed during a LOCA. <br />Arkansas Nuclear One, Unit 1 <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 3 of 4 <br />NRC FORM 366 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(06-2016) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />svildi 	 I 	 (See Page 2 for required number of digits/characters for each block) <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.govireading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/srl0221r31)  <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: <br />10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours. <br />Reported lessons learned are incorporated into the licensing process and fed back to industry. <br />Send comments regarding burden estimate to the FOIA, Privacy and Information Collections <br />Branch (T-5 F53), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, or by e-mail <br />to Infocollects.Resource@nrc.gov, and to the Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory <br />Affairs, NEOB-10202, (3150-0104), Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.

There were no other actual consequences to general safety of the public, nuclear safety, industrial <br />safety, and radiological safety for this event. <br />The potential consequences to general safety of the public, nuclear safety, industrial safety, and radiological safety <br />of this event are reduced flow to the core in the event of a large-break LOCA. However, adequate flow remains <br />available to ensure the reactor can be maintained in a safe shutdown condition. <br />Based on the above, the significance of this condition is low. <br />G. Basis for Reportability <br />10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(B): Any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of <br />structures or systems that are needed to remove residual heat. <br />10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D): Any event or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of <br />structures or systems that are needed to mitigate the consequences of an accident. <br />At the time of discovery, both trains of the DHR system were in service. Based on the location of the leak both <br />trains of DHR were declared inoperable. With both trains being declared inoperable the associated safety function <br />could not be met. In accordance with the NUREG-1022 guidelines, at the time of discovery ANO-1 made the <br />8-hour notification under EN 52271 and this LER is required. <br />H. Additional Information <br />10 CFR 50.73(b)(5) states that this report shall contain reference to "any previous similar events at the same plant <br />that are known to the licensee." NU REG 1022 reporting guidance states that term "previous occurrences" should <br />include previous events or conditions that involved the same underlying concern or reason as this event, such as <br />the same root cause, failure, or sequence of events. <br />A review of the ANO corrective action program and LERs for the previous three years was performed. No relevant <br />LER were similar to the failure mode. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 4 of 4<br /></span>
