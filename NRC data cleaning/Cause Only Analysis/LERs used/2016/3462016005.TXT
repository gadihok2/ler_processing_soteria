At 0528 hours, it was identified that all four of the Anticipatory Reactor Trip System (ARTS) 	 \ <br />channel switches were in the bypass position for the Main Turbine function while at approximately 53 percent power. <br />These switches are required by the Technical Specifications to be in the normal/enabled position when above 45 <br />percent power. The switches were restored to Normal and the applicable Technical Specifications exited at 0552 hours. <br />An Operations Standing Order was issued to require paired periodic walk downs of all Control Room panels to ensure a <br />comprehensive understanding of plant status awareness. Walk downs were also performed to independently identify <br />any additional concerns or omissions in plant startup activities. The root cause of this event is the operators failed to <br />effectively work as a team to ensure a safety system was in an operable condition when required. Corrective actions <br />include implementation of the Operations Section Continuous Improvement Plan and revision of applicable procedures. <br />This event is being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by Technical Specifications. <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LER NUMBER <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />- 005 <br />Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station Unit 1 05000- 	 346 YEAR <br />2016 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />- 00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX]. <br />System Description: <br />At the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station (DBNPS), 'the purpose of the Anticipatory Reactor Trip System <br />(ARTS) is to initiate .a reactor trip on a loss of main feedwater [SI] event or a trip of the Main Turbine [TA] at <br />power in order to reduce the magnitude of pressure and temperature transients on the Reactor Coolant <br />, System [AB]. This lowers the probability of the Pressurizer Pilot Operated Relief Valve (PORV) [AB-RV] <br />actuation during these events. The ARTS was added to the Babcock and Wilcox (B&W) designed plants <br />following the Three Mile Island Unit 2 accident, but is not credited to mitigate the consequence of any <br />accident in the Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR). <br />The ARTS consists of four separate redundant protection channels that receive inputs of Main Feedwater <br />(MFW) pump [SI-P] status and Main Turbine status.. Each protection channel contains a logic trip module, <br />which transmits trip signals to its own two-out-of-four logic and to the two-out-of-four logic of the 'logic trip <br />modules in the other three ARTS protective channels. Whenever any two ARTS channels transmit channel <br />trip signals, the logic trip module in each channel actuates to remove power from its associated Control Rod <br />Drive trip breaker [AA-BKR]. <br />Technical Specifications: <br />Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.3.16 requires three channels of the <br />ARTS instrumentation Turbine Trip function be Operable when greater than 45 percent Rated Thermal <br />Power. With one required channel inoperable, Condition A requires the channel be restored to Operable <br />status within 72 hours. If the Required Action and associated. Completion Time is not met, Condition B <br />requires reactor thermal power to be reduced to less than 45 percent power within 6 hours. TS LCO 3.3.16 <br />also requires three channels of the Trip of Both Main Feed Pump Turbines instrumentation function and four <br />channels of the Output Logic function be operable when in Mode 1. <br />DESCRIPTION OF EVENT: <br />On May 9, 2016, the unit entered Mode 1 at 1524 hours following refueling outage activities. One of the <br />projects completed during the outage was replacement of the Control Rod Drive System with a digital system <br />per Engineering Change Package (ECP) 12-0272. <br />On May 10, 2016, with the unit at approximately 53 percent power, it was identified during review of Control <br />Room Annunciators at 0528 hours that the ARTS test trip bypass annunciator was lit. The status of the ARTS <br />Trip Bypass switches was reviewed and it was identified that all four ARTS channels were in Steam Feed <br />Rupture Control System (SFRCS) [JB] bypass and Main Turbine bypass vice the expected "Normal" 	 2 <br />condition. <br />Page 2 of 5 <br />NRC FORM 366A (1 1-201 5) <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

LER NUMBER <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />- 005 <br />Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station Unit 1 05000 - 	 346 YEAR <br />2016 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />- 00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />CAUSE OF EVENT: <br />Operating Procedure DB-OP-06902, Power Operations, provides operating instructions for Main Turbine <br />startup at 18 percent power through full power operation as well as reactor shutdown. Step 4.6.5 of DB-OP-<br />06902 instructs the operator to verify ARTS is enabled prior to reaching 45 percent power. The direct cause <br />for the ARTS Trip Bypass being left in bypass for SFRCS and Main Turbine during startup is the reactor <br />operator failed to fully read and understand procedure DB-OP-06902 step 4.6.5 prior to verifying ARTS <br />enabled at approximately 40 percent power. The operator did not preview/review the task/procedure before <br />performance. <br />The root cause of this event is the operators failed to effectively work as a team to ensure a safety system <br />was in an operable condition prior to the mode of applicability for plant startup. The operators were <br />ineffective in their advocacy to understand why ARTS was in bypass and failed to get a critical review of <br />assumptions they made that plant startup procedures would, at some point, restore ARTS. <br />A contributing cause to this event is some procedures were not developed in accordance with approved <br />processes and did not contain specific guidance for restoration of ARTS after all 'four channels of all <br />parameters were placed in bypass. This was evident in temporary Test Procedure DB-TP-10405, Digital <br />Control Rod Drive System (DCRDCS) Post Installation Testing for ECP 12-0272 as well as other operating <br />procedures. <br />ANALYSIS OF EVENT: <br />With the ARTS channels in bypass, the anticipatory reactor trip signal on a Main Turbine Trip would not have <br />been provided. The reactor trip output function of SFRCS, since it uses the ARTS trip as its means of tripping <br />the reactor, would likewise have been disabled. All of the other features of the SFRCS (e.g., start Auxiliary <br />Feedwater Pumps [AB-P], align valves to isolate and/or feed water to the, Steam Generators [AB-SG]) would <br />still have functioned. As stated above, the ARTS, including the SFRCS reactor trip function to ARTS, is 'not <br />credited to mitigate the consequences of any UFSAR accident. <br />The Davis-Besse Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) model does not model ARTS or credit it for tripping <br />the reactor or mitigating any accidents or transients. All of the SFRCS functions which are modeled in the <br />PRA were still available (e.g., start Auxiliary Feedwater Pumps, align valves to isolate and/or feed water to <br />the Steam Generators). Other protective systems such as the Reactor Protection System [JC] and the Safety <br />Features Actuation System [JE] were functional, and the Immediate Action for an SFRCS trip indication is for <br />the Control Room Operators to manually trip the reactor. <br />The switch mispositioning occurred while the plant was at a reduced power level of 53 percent and with <br />minimal decay heat in the core, as it occurred during startup from a refueling outage. The plant was in this <br />condition for approximately 54 minutes. Therefore, the bypass of the ARTS channels while above 45 percent <br />reactor power is qualitatively evaluated as having very low safety significance. <br />Page 3 of 5 <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LER NUMBER <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />- 005 <br />Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station Unit 1 05000- 	 346 YEAR <br />2016 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />- 00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />ANALYSIS OF EVENT: (continued) <br />Reportability Discussion: <br />The unit attained 45 percent power at approximately 0458 hours on May 10, 2016. The discovery that all four <br />channels of ARTS were in SFRCS Bypass and Turbine-Generator Bypass occurred at 0528 hours with the <br />plant at approximately 53 percent power. 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) requires reporting of any operation or <br />condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications. TS Table 3.3.16-1 states that three <br />channels ARTS instrumentation Turbine Trip function are required to be Operable when greater than 45 <br />percent Reactor Power, so LCO 3.3.16 was not met. TS LCO 3.0.4 states that when an LCO is not met, entry <br />into a Mode or other specified condition in the Applicability shall only be made when the listed conditions (a, <br />b, or c) are met. Because these conditions were not met, the unit should not have increased power above 45 <br />percent power with 3 instrumentation channels of ARTS inoperable. Therefore, this issue is reportable as a <br />Licensee Event Report (LER) per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). Because the ARTS is not credited to mitigate the <br />consequences of any accident as described in the UFSAR, this issue does not represent a loss of safety <br />function. <br />CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: <br />Completed Actions: <br />LCO 3.3.16 Condition A and LCO 3.0.3 were entered at the time of discovery. ARTS Channels 1 through 4 <br />bypass switches were restored to Normal for both SFRCS and Main Turbine Trip functions per plant <br />operating procedures, and LCO 3.3.16 and LCO 3.0.3 were exited at 0552 hours on May 10, 2016. <br />Knowledgeable station personnel were paired in teams to perform walk downs of safety and environmentally <br />significant systems and field conditions in an effort to independently identify concerns or omissions in plant <br />startup activities. <br />Active Control Room and in-field local alarm panel annunciator windows were reviewed for an understanding <br />of status and the alarming input. The Senior Reactor Operator turnover sheet was updated to accurately <br />reflect these conditions. <br />An Operations Standing Order was developed and issued on the day of the event to require paired periodic <br />walk downs of all Control Room panels to ensure a comprehensive understanding of plant status awareness. <br />This Standing Order remains in place pending establishment of further corrective actions. <br />Scheduled Actions: <br />Preventive actions have been developed to address the root cause of this event. However, since it involves <br />crew/team behaviors, it is recognized that these actions may not be fully effective in precluding all future <br />events attributed to less than adequate teamwork. It is expected that implementation of the Operations <br />Section Cycle 20 Continuous Improvement Action Plan will act to minimize subsequent events where <br />challenges in team behaviors may lead to a gap in compliance with technical specifications. <br />Page 4 of 5 <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-201'5) <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />	<br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.
