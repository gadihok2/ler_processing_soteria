EXPECTED <br />DATE <br />MONTH DAY YEAR <br />ABSTRACT (Limit to 1400 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) <br />On May 16, 2016, at 2105 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) identified a nonconforming <br />condition involving the Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) fire dampers installed for Units 1 and 2. Specifically, it has <br />been identified that if a tornado causes a differential pressure across the east and west sides of the EDG Building, the <br />associated ventilation fire dampers have not been analyzed to withstand the corresponding high air flow rate that could <br />result from this condition and could possibly fail in a way that impedes airflow for EDG cooling. On June 8, 2016, at <br />1526 EDT, SQN determined that a tornado could potentially cause actuation of the EDG crankcase pressure trip due to <br />a low barometric condition that could result in an EDG lockout condition. The EDG lockout condition prevents <br />subsequent EDG starts (normal or emergency) until operators manually reset the lockout condition locally at the EDG. <br />Corrective actions include establishing compensatory measures to block the fire dampers in the open position in the <br />event that a Tornado WatchNVarning is issued for the Hamilton County, Tennessee area. In addition, a compensatory <br />measure has been established, that upon notification of a Tornado Warning, the EDGs will be emergency started and <br />operated during the time the Tornado Warning is in effect to bypass the crankcase pressure trip function and allow the <br />EDGs to perform their required safety function. The apparent cause of these events is misjudgment regarding the <br />intent of the Regulatory Issue Summary 2006-23. The corrective actions developed in response to the RIS were too <br />narrowly focused on ductwork and ventilating dampers withstanding the effects of a tornado. <br />NRC FORM 366 (11.2015) <br />1.

PLANT OPERATING CONDITIONS BEFORE THE EVENT <br />At the time of the events, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Unit 1 and Unit 2 were in Mode 1 at 100 <br />percent rated thermal power. <br />II. DESCRIPTION OF EVENTS <br />A. Event: <br />On May 16, 2016, at 2105 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) <br />identified a nonconforming condition involving the Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) [EIIS <br />Code EK and DG] fire dampers [EIIS Code DMP] installed for Units 1 and 2. Specifically, it has <br />been identified that if a tornado causes a differential pressure across the east and west sides of <br />the EDG Building, this could create a high airflow rate through the EDG Building ventilation path. <br />The fire dampers for each EDG bay have not been analyzed to withstand high air flows resulting <br />from a tornado and could possibly fail in a way that impedes airflow for EDG cooling. This is an <br />unanalyzed condition that potentially significantly degrades plant safety and could prevent all <br />EDGs from supplying electrical power as designed during a tornado or other similar weather <br />events. <br />On June 8, 2016, at 1526 EDT, another issue was identified involving the potential impact of a <br />tornado on the EDGs. The EDGs are designed with a crankcase pressure trip [EIIS Code PS], <br />which is bypassed during an emergency start. A tornado could potentially cause actuation of the <br />crankcase pressure trip due to a low barometric condition. If an emergency start signal has not <br />previously occurred, then during a tornado, actuation of the crankcase pressure trip would <br />energize the shutdown relay causing an EDG lockout condition. The EDG lockout condition <br />prevents subsequent EDG starts (normal or emergency) until operators manually reset the <br />lockout condition locally at the EDG. This condition places both units in an unanalyzed condition <br />that potentially significantly degrades plant safety and could potentially affect all four EDGs <br />simultaneously. <br />B. Status of structures, components, or systems that were inoperable at the start of the event <br />and contributed to the event: <br />No inoperable structures, components, or systems contributed to this event. <br />Page 2 of 6 <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />1.

CAUSE OF THE EVENT <br />A. The cause of each component or system failure or personnel error, if known: <br />The apparent cause of these events is misjudgment regarding the intent of Regulatory Issue <br />Summary (RIS) 2006-23, Post-Tornado Operability of Ventilating and Air-Conditioning Systems <br />Housed in Emergency Diesel Generator Rooms." The corrective actions developed in response <br />to RIS 2006-23 were too narrowly focused on ductwork and ventilating dampers withstanding the <br />effects of a tornado, and did not conservatively expand the analysis limits to include all safety <br />related components within the ventilating system. <br />B. The cause(s) and circumstances for each human performance related root cause: <br />The human performance issue that contributed to the cause was a wrong assumption or <br />preconceived idea. The decision to analyze the ductwork and dampers, as opposed to all <br />components of the ventilation system, appears to have been a non-conservative decision; <br />however, the decision also appears to have been more of a misunderstanding of the intent of the <br />RIS. Since the licensee response that prompted RIS 2006-23 only analyzed vulnerable duct <br />segments, it led to a predisposition of the initiator of the CR to suggest that only the ductwork <br />and dampers needed to be analyzed. These precursors led to a faulty scope. The decision <br />does not appear to be deliberately non-conservative. The personnel involved with the response <br />to the CR were adequately trained in both general engineering principles and work group specific <br />training. <br />IV. ANALYSIS OF THE EVENT <br />All 4 EDGs are required to be operable by both units' Technical Specifications to provide electrical <br />power to safe shutdown/safety related equipment following accident conditions coincident with a loss <br />of offsite power. The Current Licensing Basis (CLB) requires that tornado effects be considered in <br />the design of safety related structures, systems, and components. It could not be demonstrated at <br />the time of the events that the fire dampers and crankcase pressure switches would withstand the <br />design basis tornado. <br />The EDGs are operable, but degraded and have successfully passed their required surveillances <br />within the appropriate frequency. The occurrence of such an event involving failure of the fire <br />dampers or the crankcase pressure switches is highly unlikely and there was no imminent concern <br />regarding severe weather involving tornadoes. <br />In order to prevent any operability issues with the EDG due to tornado damage to the EDG building or <br />components, compensatory measures have been developed to address the associated <br />nonconformance. These compensatory measures will be accomplished by physically blocking open <br />the fire dampers, and removing an access port downstream of one of each pair of the EDG exhaust <br />fan dampers. It will be implemented promptly upon site notification of a Tornado Watch or Warning. <br />A compensatory measure has also been established, that upon notification of a Tornado Warning, the <br />EDGs will be emergency started and operated during the time the Tornado Warning is in effect to <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />1.

ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES <br />The EDGs are located inside the power plant structure and are capable of performing their <br />safety function. The occurrence of such an event involving failure of the fire dampers or the <br />crankcase pressure switches is highly unlikely and there was no imminent concern regarding <br />severe weather involving tornadoes at the time of the events. <br />A risk assessment has been completed and has determined that the change in core damage <br />frequency is less than 1E-6 for failures of both the EDG fire dampers and crankcase pressure <br />switches, which is of very low safety significance. <br />A. Availability of systems or components that could have performed the same function as the <br />components and systems that failed during the event: <br />There were no component failures. <br />B. For events that occurred when the reactor was shut down, availability of systems or <br />components needed to shutdown the reactor and maintain safe shutdown conditions, <br />remove residual heat, control the release of radioactive material, or mitigate the <br />consequences of an accident: <br />These events did not occur when the reactor was shutdown. <br />C. For failure that rendered a train of a safety system inoperable, an estimate of the elapsed <br />time from discovery of the failure until the train was returned to service: <br />With the compensatory measures in place, the EDGs will remain capable of fulfilling their design <br />basis function following a tornado. <br />VI. 	 CORRECTIVE ACTIONS <br />This event was entered into the Tennessee Valley Authority Corrective Action Program under <br />Condition Reports (CR) 1170545, 1178891, and 1181710. <br />A. Immediate Corrective Actions: <br />8-hour non-emergency notifications were made to the NRC to report the events as <br />unanalyzed conditions that significantly degrade plant safety per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B). <br />B. Corrective actions to reduce probability of similar events occurring in the future: <br />Corrective actions include establishing compensatory measures to block the fire dampers <br />in the open position in the event that a Tornado Watch/Warning is issued for the Hamilton <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />1.

In addition, a compensatory measure has been established, <br />that upon notification of a Tornado Warning, the EDGs will be emergency <br />started and operated during the time the Tornado Warning is in effect to bypass the <br />crankcase pressure trip function and allow the EDGs to perform their required safety <br />function. <br />Further corrective actions include establishing the bounding criteria for evaluation of other <br />components that are subject to the effects of a tornado that could impact the safe <br />operation of safety related equipment in Category I structures, fully evaluating the <br />components of the EDG building ventilation system, and fully evaluating the components <br />in the EDG building that are subject to the effects of a tornado that could impact the <br />operation of the EDGs. <br />VII.
