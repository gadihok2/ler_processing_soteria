Initially, the <br />LOP instrumentation was incorrectly considered OPERABLE; however, later reviews of the condition determined that the LOP <br />instrumentation was inoperable. Later reviews also concluded that the Division 1 Alternating Current (AC) Source was inoperable from <br />1644 to 1920 on April 24, 2016, and the Division 1 Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) 12 was inoperable starting at 1644 on April 24, <br />2016, until it was restored at 1818 on May 8, 2016, during a Forced Outage following replacement of the blown PT fuses. On six <br />occasions from April 26-30, 2016, Division 2 EDGs 13 and/or 14 were inoperable for planned surveillances. Therefore, this is an event <br />or condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function to remove residual heat and mitigate the consequences of an <br />accident. Furthermore, failure to enter applicable Limiting Conditions for Operation resulted in a condition prohibited by Technical <br />'Specifications. The cause of the event was concluded to be a low energy transient event resulting in the blown PT primary fuses. The <br />incorrect initial operability determination was caused by Operators being unfamiliar with this equipment condition. Operators <br />completed a Department Event Free Day Reset and Event Review and will receive additional training on this condition. <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016) <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(06 2016) <br />.`% 	 LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />4.0 '° <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://vvviim.nrc.govireadipg-rm/doc-collectionsintiregs/striff/srl.Q22/01)  <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150.0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden par response to comply with this mandatory col!ection request: 80 nours.

An initial investigation revealed that the Potential Transformer (PT) <br />[[XPT]] for Buses [[BU]] 64A and 64C was not providing an output voltage signal to the relaying and instrumentation <br />downstream of the PTs. Half of the loss of voltage (LOV) relays [[27]] and half of the degraded voltage relays (DVRs) for <br />the 4.16 kiloVolt (kV) Emergency Bus 64C undervoltage were tripped while the other half of both of those relays were not <br />tripped. Therefore, the LOP instrumentation trip logic was in a half-tripped state. The LOV relays and DVRs together <br />constitute the Technical Specification (TS) 3.3.8.1 Loss of Power (LOP) instrumentation to detect and respond to a loss of <br />offsite power (LOOP) event. <br />Licensed Operators initially incorrectly considered SS64 OPERABLE based on the proper voltage being maintained on <br />Engineered Safety Feature (ESF) Buses 64B and 64C. Initially, the Division 1 Bus 64C LOP instrumentation was also <br />incorrectly considered OPERABLE by Licensed Operators because the relays failed in their fail safe condition and the <br />logic was capable of performing the safety function. The failure resulted in the LOP instrumentation going from a one out <br />of two, taken twice, logic to a one out of two logic, which would have properly detected and responded to a loss of offsite <br />power or degraded voltage event. <br />At 1920 EDT on April 24, 2016, Operators restored the SS64 output voltage to above 121.3 meter Volts (V) by manual <br />operation of the Load Tap Changer (LTC) [[TTC]] as required by System Operating Procedure 23.320, "Balance of Plant <br />Auxiliary Electrical Distribution System" (Revision 63). Restoration of the voltage to 121.3 meter V ensured that adequate <br />voltage was available to reset the LOV relays and DVRs during a LOCA coincident with a degraded grid. <br />Division 2 offsite power and Combustion Turbine Generator (CTG) [[88]] 11-1 were OPERABLE at all times during the <br />event. <br />Although the equipment was initially determined to be OPERABLE, repairs were still required. Fermi 2 entered Mode 3 at <br />2301 EDT on May 3, 2016, and subsequently, entered Mode 4 at 1525 EDT on May 4, 2016, for Forced Outage (FO) <br />16-01 to trouble-shoot and repair the LOP instrumentation. <br />Subsequent analysis of this event by Engineering determined that: <br />A. Starting at 1644 on April 24, 2016, with the LTC automatic function disabled and voltage below 121.3 meter V, per <br />Design Calculation (DC) 6447 Volume I, "Auxiliary Power System Analysis," (Revision C) the DVRs may not have reset <br />upon a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) auto-start of ESF equipment in order to stay connected to the preferred offsite <br />power source. Manual operation of the SS64 LTC by Operations boosted the output voltage of SS64 and ensured <br />adequate voltage to reset the DVRs at 1920 on April 24, 2016. <br />NRC FORM 366A (Co-2016) 	 Page 	 2 	 of 	 6 <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(06-2010) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />F • <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http;//wwv,/..nrc„govireading-rm/doc-collectionsinurcgs/staff/sr1022/13/) <br /> <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 <br />	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Lstimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collector' request: 80 hours.

LER NUMBER <br />Fermi 2 341 <br />YEAR SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />REV <br />NO. <br />2016 009 00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />TS Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.3.8.1 requires the LOP instrumentation to have four functional channels <br />[[CHA]] for each Division. Resetting of the LOV relays and DVRs is not an explicit TS 3.3.8.1 Surveillance Requirement <br />(SR) although the reset of the LOV relays and DVRs is credited in the electrical analysis. With both the LOV relays and <br />DVRs (connected across phase-to-neutral of the line side PTs) remaining tripped, there was no way to reset these tripped <br />relays in situ to return to initial conditions or to apply the existing test procedure to test the LOP instrumentation channels <br />for compliance with TS SRs 3.3.8.1.1 and 3.3.8.1.3. Therefore, the LOP instrumentation was inoperable from 1644 on <br />April 24, 2016, until 1818 on May 8, 2016. <br />B. Between 1644 and 1920 on April 24, 2016, Division 1 Alternating Current (AC) Source lost its functionality due to the <br />inability of SS64 to deliver three phase AC power at the required voltage range stemming from its loss of voltage <br />reference required for LTC automatic operation. SS64 output voltage was restored at 1920 to above 121.3 meter V by <br />manual operation of the LTC in accordance with System Operating Procedure 23.320. Therefore, Division 1 AC Source <br />was inoperable from 1644 to 1920 on April 24, 2016. <br />C. At 1644 on April 24, 2016, Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) [[DG]] 12 lost its voltage reference required for <br />synchronization across Breaker [[BKR]] C6 upon restoration of offsite power source. EDG 12 would not have been able to <br />pass TS SR 3.8.1.15, which requires each EDG to synchronize with offsite power while loaded with emergency loads <br />upon a simulated restoration of offsite power, transfer loads to offsite power, and return to standby status. The loss of <br />synchronization capability lasted until the primary fuses for the ESF Bus 64C line side PTs were replaced on May 7, 2016, <br />during FO 16-01. The loss of voltage reference did not affect the ability of EDG 12 to start and load in an accident <br />scenario, but EDG 12 could not be manually synchronized with offsite power to allow loads to be transferred back to <br />offsite power. Therefore, EDG 12 was inoperable from 1644 on April 24, 2016, until 1818 on May 8, 2016, when it was <br />returned to service. <br />Based on the Engineering analysis, multiple LCOs should have been entered by Operations based on inoperability of <br />plant equipment as a result of this event. Because these LCOs were not entered, a number of LCO Conditions were not <br />met. Specifically: <br />1. Due to the Division 1 AC Source being inoperable, LCO 3.8.1, Condition D for one inoperable offsite circuit should have <br />been entered from 1644 to 1920 on April 24, 2016. Required Action D.1, which requires performing TS SR 3.8.1.1 for the <br />OPERABLE offsite circuit, has a Completion Time of 1 hour, which was not met. TS SR 3.8.1.1 verifies correct breaker <br />alignment and indicated power availability for each offsite circuit. Although TS SR 3.8.1.1 was not performed, Division 2 <br />offsite power was available. All other Required Actions for this Condition have Completion Times that are longer than the <br />duration of this condition. <br />2. Due to the LOP instrumentation being inoperable, LCO 3.3.8.1 Condition A for one or more buses with one or more <br />channels inoperable should have been entered at 1644 on April 24, 2016. LCO 3.3.8.1 Condition A Required Action A.1 <br />requires that the channel be restored to OPERABLE status within 72 hours. The LOP channels were not restored in 72 <br />hours and therefore, LCO 3.3.8.1 Condition B should have been entered at 1644 on April 27, 2016. LCO 3.3.8.1 <br />Condition B Required Action B.1 requires that the associated EDG be declared inoperable immediately when Condition A <br />could not be met. Therefore, both of these Required Action Completion Times were not met. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 	 3 	 of 	 6 <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(06-2016) <br />1,111,,t,  <br />''' 	 P,, 	 LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />e <br />: 	 CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

Due to EDG 12 being inoperable starting at 1644 on April 24, 2016, LCO 3.8.1 Condition A for one EDG inoperable <br />should have been entered until Mode 4 was entered at 1525 on May 4, 2016. LCO 3.8.1 Condition A Required Action A.1 <br />requires that TS SR 3.8.1.1 be performed for operable offsite power circuit(s) within one hour and once per 8 hours <br />thereafter. Although TS SR 3.8.1.1 was not performed at the required times, Division 2 offsite power was available <br />throughout this event. LCO 3.8.1 Condition A Required Action A.2 states that required feature(s), supported by the <br />inoperable EDGs, must be declared inoperable within 4 hours when the redundant required feature(s) are inoperable. <br />This Required Action was not performed and during the timeframe EDG 12 was inoperable work was performed on <br />required redundant features in Division 2. Some of this work exceeded four hours; therefore, this Required Action was not <br />met. LCO 3.8.1 Condition A Required Action A.3 requires verifying the status of CTG 11-1 once per 8 hours, and <br />Required Action A.5 requires restoration of CTG 11-1 within 72 hours of discovery of this condition concurrent with CTG <br />11-1 not being available. Required Action A.3 was not performed; however, CTG 11-1 was available throughout this time. <br />Therefore, Required Action A.5 would not have applied. LCO 3.8.1 Condition A also has a 24 hour Completion Time to <br />either determine operable EDGs are not inoperable due to common cause failure (Required Action A.4.1) or perform TS <br />SR 3.8.1.2 for operable EDGs (Required Action A.4.2). Neither Required Action A.4.1 nor Required Action A.4.2 was <br />performed at the time they were applicable; however, no EDGs were inoperable due to common cause failure as no other <br />EDGs were affected by this condition. LCO 3.8.1 Condition A Required Action A.6 requires restoring the EDG to <br />OPERABLE status within 14 days. As previously noted, Mode 3 was entered on May 3, 2016, and Mode 4 was entered <br />on May 4, 2016 (approximately 10 days later). Finally, LCO 3.8.1 Condition G requires the reactor to be in Mode 3 in 12 <br />hours if the Required Actions and associated Completion Times of Condition A are not met. Based on the shortest LCO <br />3.8.1 Condition A Completion Time (1 hour for Required Action A.1), the LCO 3.8.1 Condition G Completion Time was not <br />met. <br />4. During the timeframe when Division 1 EDG 12 was inoperable, planned surveillances (SRs) were performed on the <br />Division 2 EDGs (13 and 14). The following list delineates when the Division 2 EDGs were inoperable. <br />• EDGs 13 and 14 were both inoperable during the following timeframes: <br />a) 1455 to 2215 on April 27, 2016, and <br />b) 0033 to 0446 on April 30, 2016. <br />• EDG 13 was inoperable on April 26, 2016, during the following timeframes: <br />c) 1706 to 1806, and <br />d) 1957 to 2207. <br />• EDG 14 was inoperable on April 30, 2016, during the following timeframes: <br />e) 0909 to 1033, and <br />f) 1535 to 1611. <br />LCO 3.8.1 Condition C Required Action C.1 requires that if one or both EDGs in both divisions are inoperable, both EDGs <br />in one division be restored to OPERABLE status within two hours. This LCO Condition was not entered. Timeframes a, <br />b, and d exceeded two hours; however, timeframes c, e, and f were less than two hours. As previously noted, LCO 3.8.1 <br />Condition G requires the reactor to be in Mode 3 in 12 hours if the Required Action and associated Completion Time of <br />Condition C are not met. LCO 3.8.1 Condition G was not entered; however, none of the timeframes (a through f) when <br />EDGs 13 and/or 14 were inoperable exceeded 12 hours. Therefore, this LCO Completion Time is longer than the duration <br />of this condition. <br />As noted in Example 3 above, LCO 3.8.1 Condition A Required Action A.2 and an identical LCO (3.8.1 Condition B <br />Required Action B.2 for two EDGs in one division inoperable) state that required feature(s), supported by the inoperable <br />EDGs, must be declared inoperable within four hours when the redundant required feature(s) are inoperable.

LER NUMBER <br />Fermi 2 341 <br />YEAR SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />REV <br />NO. <br />2016 009 00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />Required Actions were performed during the timeframes a through f as required; however, Operators did not know at the <br />time that EDG 12 was inoperable. If Operators had known that EDG 12 was inoperable, the SRs on Division 2 EDGs 13 <br />and/or 14 in timeframes a through f would not have been performed. <br />Both EDGs in one division are required to provide AC power. The six timeframes (a through f) noted above when one or <br />both of EDGs 13 and 14 were inoperable while EDG 12 was inoperable are reportable based on meeting the criteria of <br />Title 10 Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) 50.73(a)(2)(v) (B) and (D) for an event or condition that could have <br />prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to remove residual heat and <br />mitigate the consequences of an accident, respectively. <br />Because the instances described in this LER occurred in the past and there was no loss of safety function at the time of <br />discovery, no Event Notification was made under the corresponding requirement in 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v)(B) and (D). <br />Furthermore, examples 1 through 4 where LCOs were not entered and thus, multiple Completion Times were not met are <br />Conditions Prohibited by TS and are reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). <br />SIGNIFICANT SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS <br />There were no safety consequences or radiological releases associated with these events. <br />The EDGs provide backup power if a loss of offsite power occurs. There are two fully redundant divisions, each having <br />two EDGs. Therefore, there was no actual loss of safety function during the times when the Division 2 EDGs (13 and 14) <br />were both OPERABLE while a Division 1 EDG (EDG 12) was inoperable. <br />The LOP instrumentation is implemented by two undervoltage functions, LOV relays and DVRs. Both the LOV relays and <br />DVRs connected across phase-to-neutral of the Bus 64C PTs correctly responded to the blown PT fuses. The 130 V <br />Direct Current (DC) supply for control of the undervoltage relays remained functional. The other relays (two for LOV and <br />two for DVR scheme) connected across phase-to-phase of the Bus 64C PTs were not tripped. Therefore, the LOP <br />instrumentation went from a one out of two, taken twice, logic to a one out of two logic and remained capable of fulfilling its <br />design functions. <br />During a LOCA coincident with a degraded grid condition, the LOV relays and DVRs may not have reset starting at 1644 <br />on April 24, 2016, until Operations increased the voltage above 121.3 meter V by manually using the SS64 LTC at 1920 <br />on April 24, 2016. With the LOV relays and DVRs remaining in half-tripped position, the first occurrence of a degraded <br />grid voltage may have led to premature separation of the Class lE buses from the preferred offsite source, starting EDGs <br />11 and 12, and re-sequencing the safety loads. In this event, safety loads would have been powered by EDGs 11 and 12 <br />to maintain the reactor in a safe condition. Although EDG 12 could not be manually synchronized with offsite power to <br />allow loads to be transferred back to offsite power as a result of this condition, the EDGs have a seven day fuel supply, as <br />required by TS 3.8.3. This would provide time for a temporary modification and procedure change to transfer the loads <br />back to offsite power. <br />Therefore, although Division 1 EDG 12 should have been declared inoperable starting at 1644 on April 24, 2016, the <br />inoperable LOP relays would not impact the capability of EDG 12 to start and assume loads during a design basis event. <br />The LOP logic in the half tripped condition remained capable of starting the EDG upon a sensed loss of grid or degraded <br />grid condition. Therefore, during the six timeframes when EDGs in both divisions were inoperable due to surveillances <br />being performed on the Division 2 EDGs 13 and/or 14, both Division 1 EDGs remained capable of performing their safety-<br />related functions to start and assume loads during a design basis event. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 	 5 	 of 	 6 <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(C5-2016) <br />441.V:9 <br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />Page <br />	 6 	 of 	 6 NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />htlp://mAny.nm.goyireprilnc. rin/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sI10221r3/) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 <br />	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

LER NUMBER <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />009 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />00 <br />05000- <br />NARRATIVE <br />Furthermore, Division 2 offsite power remained functional throughout the event. There was no report of inoperability or <br />malfunction with Class 1 E equipment or onsite generation systems with Division 2. Therefore, reactor cooling and safety <br />was always supported with at least one division of fully functional offsite power source and onsite generation. <br />CAUSE OF THE EVENT <br />The Direct Cause of the LOP instrumentation being inoperable was an open circuit. The phase-to-neutral PT high side <br />fuses were blown on non-safety Bus 64A and safety-related Bus 64C, resulting in a loss of output from the PTs. A failure <br />analysis performed by a third-party laboratory confirmed that the fuses had opened on a low energy transient event. The <br />source of the low energy transient event could not be determined, but it appears to have been intermittent from either the <br />4160 V secondary side of SS64 or a transient on the 120 kV grid. <br />The cause of Operators not entering the required LCOs was unfamiliarity with this equipment condition and a failure to <br />recognize the impacts of the condition. <br />CORRECTIVE ACTIONS <br />Transformer 64 Buses 64A, 64B, 64C, and 64V were inspected and the fuses were replaced during FO 16-01, which <br />restored compliance with the TS requirements. A Temporary Modification was installed to monitor Bus 64A to detect <br />future transients. <br />Operations completed a Department Event Free Day Reset and Event Review. <br />Other Corrective Actions include additional training for Operators on the issues described in this LER. <br />PREVIOUS OCCURRENCES <br />There are no previous LERs for similar events for a low energy transient event resulting in blown phase-to-neutral fuses <br />on the PT relays. <br />LER 2015-009 documented an event on July 28, 2015, where Operators failed to enter an LCO during planned work on <br />the UHS. In this event, the missed LCO entries were an inadvertent deletion by the Operators during preparation of the <br />LCO log entries. Therefore, the Corrective Actions associated with LER 2015-009 would not have prevented the incorrect <br />Operability determination and missed LCO entries discussed in this LER. <br />On January 6, 2016, an LCO entry was not made when the East and West Turbine Bypass Valves opened during High <br />Pressure Stop Valve 1 drifted closed to 25%. This missed LCO entry was due to a non-conservative decision by the <br />Operators. Contributing to this decision was a misinterpretation of an overly conservative statement in the TS Bases. <br />This event was reported in LER 2016-001. Therefore, the Corrective Actions associated with this event would riot have <br />prevented the incorrect Operability determination and missed LCO entries discussed in this LER. <br />ADDITIONAL INFORMATION <br />Failed Component: Phase-to-neutral PT fuses <br />Manufacturer: General Electric <br />Model Number: EJ-1 1E<br /></span>
