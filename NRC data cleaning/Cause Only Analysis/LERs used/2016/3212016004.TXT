The test results showed that two SRVs <br />were slightly out of spec low due to setpoint drift. <br />The SRV pilots were disassembled and inspected while investigating the reason for the drift. SNC has determined that the <br />abutment gap closed pre-maturely. The pre-mature abutment gap closure is most likely due to loose manufacturing <br />tolerances leading to SRV setpoint drift. <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />111-2015) <br />\ 	 41 	 LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

SNC has determined that <br />the linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) used to measure displacement confirmed the abutment gap closed pre-<br />maturely. The pre-mature abutment gap closure is most likely due to loose manufacturing tolerances leading to SRV <br />setpoint drift. <br />REPORTABILITY ANALYSIS AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT <br />This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) because a condition occurred that is prohibited by TS <br />3.4.3. Specifically, an example of multiple test failures is given in NUREG-1022, Revision 3, "Event Reporting Guidelines <br />10 CFR 50.72 and 50.73" which describes the sequential testing of safety valves. This example notes that "Sometimes <br />multiple valves are found to lift with set points outside of technical specification limits." NUREG-1022 further states in the <br />example that "discrepancies found in TS surveillance tests should be assumed to occur at the time of the test unless there <br />is firm evidence, based on a review of relevant information (e.g., the equipment history and the cause of failure), to <br />indicate that the discrepancy occurred earlier. However, the existence of similar discrepancies in multiple valves is an <br />indication that the discrepancies may well have arisen over a period of time and the failure mode should be evaluated to <br />make this determination." Based on this guidance, the determination was made that this "as found" condition is reportable <br />under the reporting requirements of 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER a LER NUMBER <br />YEAR REV <br />NO <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />2016 	 - 004 	 - 00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />There are eleven SRVs located on the four main steam lines within the drywell in between the reactor pressure vessel <br />(RPV) (EIIS Code RPV) and the inboard main steam isolation valves (MSIVs) (EIIS Code ISV). These SRVs are required <br />to be operable during Modes 1, 2, and 3 to limit the peak pressure in the nuclear system such that it will not exceed the <br />applicable ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Limits for the reactor coolant pressure boundary. The SRVs are tested <br />in accordance with TS Surveillance Requirement 3.4.3.1 in which the valves are tested as directed by the In-Service <br />Testing Program to verify lift set points are within their specified limits to confirm they would perform their required safety <br />function of overpressure protection. The SRVs must accommodate the most severe pressurization transient which, for the <br />purposes of demonstrating compliance with the ASME Code Limit of 1375 psig peak vessel pressure, has been defined <br />by an event involving the closure of all MSIVs with a failure of the direct reactor protection system trip from the MSIV <br />position switches with the reactor ultimately shutting down as the result of a high neutron flux trip (a scenario designated <br />as MSIVF). <br />The two SRVs which failed to meet their Tech Spec required actuation pressure setpoint lifted early (3.2% low and 3.8% low). <br />None of the eleven SRVs tested this cycle had as-found test results out of range high. Therefore, since the two identified SRVs <br />lifted earlier than expected, the ASME Code Limit of 1375 psig peak vessel pressure would be maintained under normal and <br />accident conditions. The opening of one or more SRVs at lower pressures would result in a less severe transient with reduced <br />peak vessel pressure. Also, the slightly lower actuating pressure does not pose a significant LOCA initiator threat because the <br />reactor steam dome would not experience >1100 psig during normal operation. <br />Based on the observed setpoint drift slightly low, the overpressure protection system would have continued to perform its <br />required safety function if called upon in its "as found" condition. Therefore, this event had no adverse impact on nuclear <br />safety and was of very low safety significance. <br />CORRECTIVE ACTIONS <br />The vendor specifications will be revised to tighten as-left tolerances of abutment and pre-load gap, increase the minimum <br />set for abutment pressure at the high end of specification, and tighten diametrical and face run-out tolerances for bellows <br />assembly on pre-load spacer mounting end. <br />Edwin I.

Corrective actions included replacement of the <br />2-stage SRVs with 3-stage SRVs which typically do not exhibit set point drift. The setpoint drift was out of spec high while <br />the event discussed in LER 1-2016-004 have failed to meet acceptance criteria by drifting out of spec low. <br />LER 1-2012-004 identified multiple SRV setpoint drift for 8 of the 11 SRVs. Corrective actions included replacement of the <br />2-stage SRVs with 2-stage SRVs whose pilot discs had undergone a platinum surface treatment which was considered at <br />that time to be the long term fix for this corrosion bonding issue. <br />Edwin I.
