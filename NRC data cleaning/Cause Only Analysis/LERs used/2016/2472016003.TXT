ABSTRACT (Limit to 1400 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced type written lines) <br />On March 7, 2016, during a refueling outage the control switch for the 21 Main Boiler <br />Feedwater Pump (MBFP) was positioned to trip and the 21 MBFP tripped as designed but the <br />MBFP discharge valve BFD-2-21 failed to fully close. 	 MBFP discharge valve BFD-2-21 was <br />declared inoperable and Technical Specification (TS) 	 3.7.3 	 (Main Feedwater Isolation) <br />Condition C (One or both MBFP discharge valves inoperable) was entered. 	 Troubleshooting <br />on the valve determined the close torque switch contact finger was out of position <br />within the contact holder. 	 This misalignment allowed the contact finger to move out of <br />the proper position causing Motor Operated Valve (MOV) BFD-2-21 to fail to close. <br />Direct cause was valve BFD-2-21 close torque- switch was out of position. 	 The apparent <br />cause was the MOV preventive maintenance procedure lacked the level of detail and <br />direction to provide the appropriate guidance to recognize the susceptibility associated <br />with the orientation of the close torque switch contact finger bracket opening and <br />spreading of the "U" shape bracket. 	 Corrective actions included replacement of the <br />defective torque switch, 	 inspection and testing. 	 A case study from this event will be <br />developed and included in the continual ESP training. 	 The adequacy of the guidance on <br />work instruction on the arrangement/alignment of the contact "U" shape brackets will be <br />evaluated and the necessary guidance provided. 	 The event had no significant effect on <br />public health and safety. <br />NRC FORM366AU.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(01-2014) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />FACILITY NAME (1) DOCKET (2) LER NUMBER (6) PAGE (3) <br />YEAR <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER  <br />REVISION <br />NUMBER <br />Indian Point Unit 2  05000-247  2016 	 003 	 00 2 OF 4 <br />NARRATIVE (If more space is required, use additional copies of NRC Form 366A) (17) <br />Note: 	 The Energy Industry Identification System Codes are identified within the <br />brackets a. <br />DESCRIPTION OF EVENT <br />On March 7, 2016, at approximately 00:10 hours, during plant shutdown for refueling <br />outage cycle 22, while in Mode 3 (Hot Standby), the control switch {33} for the 21 Main <br />Boiler Feedwater Pump (MBFP) {SJ} was positioned to trip and the 21 MBFP tripped as <br />designed but the MBFP discharge valve BFD-2-21 {ISV}failed to close. Operations <br />observed a duel light indication for BFD-2-21 valve position on Control Room Panel FAF <br />identifying the valve failed to fully close. MBFP discharge valve BFD-2-21 was <br />declared inoperable and Technical Specification (TS) 3.7.3 (Main Feedwater Isolation) <br />Condition C (One or both MBFP discharge valves inoperable) was entered. TS 3.7.3 <br />Required Action C.1 is to close or isolate the MBFP discharge valves within 72 hours,. <br />and C.2 verify MBFP discharge valves are closed or isolated once per 7 days. At 3:15 <br />hours, valve BFD-2-21 was manually closed and de-energized then cracked open 20 hand <br />wheel turns off its seat'to eliminate. thermal binding concerns. The condition was <br />recorded in the Indian Point Energy Center (IPEC) Corrective Action Program (CAP) in <br />Condition Report CR-IP2-2016-01236. <br />On March 7, 2016, troubleshooting commenced at approximately 19:47 hours, to determine <br />the cause of the valve BFD-2-21 failure to close. On March 9, 2016, during . <br />troubleshooting.of'valve BFD-2-21, when the limit switch compartment cover was removed <br />the close torque switch contact finger was found slipped out of position within the <br />contact holder. Inspection of the failed torque switch identified that the "U" shaped <br />contact holder was slightly bent 'or spread open and the tabs at each end of the holder <br />were not parallel with each other. Engineering concluded this misalignment would allow <br />the contact finger to have free play within the contact holder. Excessive free play <br />within the contact holder contributed to the contact finger moving out of the proper <br />position. In addition, the orientation and arrangement of BFD-2-21 actuator/torque <br />switch is such thatโขthe opening in the contact holder is angled slightly downward. <br />This orientation would make it easier for the contact finger to slip out of the gap. <br />On March 9, 2016, the torque switch was replaced and the valve stroke tested <br />satisfactory. Discussions were held with the original torque switch manufacturer <br />(Limitorque) (OEM) and they recommended that during installation of the new torque <br />switch specific additional inspections be performed and the Indian Point MOV preventive <br />maintenance (PM) procedure be enhanced. Limitorque also recommended an enhancement <br />which could provide a' heavier duty compression spring (located under the contact <br />finger) which would aid in preventing recurrence of this type failure. After a major <br />PM on the valve, inspections' and diagnostic testing were performed to monitor torque <br />switch operation and proper torque switch contact holder assembly. <br />The closed circuit for motor operated valve (MOV) BFD-2-21 is supervised by"limit <br />switch 8. Limit switch 8 (LS8) is set to open and de-energize the motor after the <br />valve disc contacts the valve seat (closed position). The closed torque switch is in <br />series with the close LS8 and provides mechanical overload protection. The closed <br />torque switch is set high enough so that normal operation of BFD-2-21 will not cause <br />its contacts to open. The closed torque switch is bypassed using Limit Switch 9 (LM9) <br />for the first two seconds of the closing stroke. This ensures full motor capability is <br />available to start the valve close which will initiate the trip signals to the MBFPs. <br />After two seconds the close torque switch bypass is out of the circuit and the valve <br />will continue to close until either LS8 or the Close torque switch contacts opens. <br />The MBFP discharge valve BFD-2-21 is a motor operated gate valve with a torque switch, <br />model number SMB-3 (actuator) manufactured by Limitorque {L200} (Flowserve)-โข-part <br />number 11501-042 (Torque switch)'(33}.

Flow into the SGs <br />is controlled by regulating the FW pump apedd'and individual SG level control valves. <br />FW discharge from the FW pumps is through check valves and motor operated gate valves <br />into a common header. <br />An extent of condition (EOC) review determined the unique conditions of the alignment, <br />orientation of the torque switch-contact finger and spreading of the "U" shape bracket <br />would be applicable to the 22 MBFP discharge valve (BFD-2-22), Valve BFD-2-22 was <br />inspected and stroked properly and closed with no issues. A corrective action was <br />initiated to evaluate the remaining population of MOVs for a similar condition. <br />CaUse of Event <br />Direct cause of the failure to close of MBFP discharge valve BFD-2-21 was the valve's <br />close torque switch contact finger was out of position. The apparent cause- was the MOV <br />preventive maintenance procedure lacked the level of detail and direction due to an <br />unrecognized susceptibility associated with the orientation of the close torque switch <br />contact finger bracket opening and spreading of the "U" shape bracket. The downward <br />arrangement makes it easier for the torque switch contact finger to move out with <br />spreading of the "U" shape contact holder. The closed torque switch contact finger was <br />misaligned in the retaining bracket. <br />Corrective Actions <br />The following corrective actions have been or will be performed under Entergy's. <br />Corrective Action Program to address the cause and prevent recurrence: <br />โข The defective torque switch was replaced and BFD-2-21 and BFD-2-22 were inspected <br />and tested. 	 โข <br />โข MBFP 22 discharge valve BFD-2-22 was inspected and a Work Order implemented to <br />validate BFD-2-22 was acceptable. <br />โข The remaining population of motor operated valves (MOVs) will be evaluated for a <br />similar condition. <br />โข A case study from this event will be developed and included in the continual ESP <br />training. <br />โข The adequacy of the guidance on work instruction on the arrangement/alignment of the <br />contact "U" shape brackets will be evaluated and the necessary guidance provided to <br />either the fleet procedure (EN-MA-141) or the Work Program (Asset Suite. <br />Event Analysis <br />The event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a) (2)(i)(B). The licensee shall report any <br />operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's TS. This condition meets <br />the reporting criteria because TS 3.7.3 (Main Feedwater System) requires the two MBFP <br />discharge valves and the trip function to be operable. TS 3.7.3 Condition C (One or <br />both MBFP discharge valves inoperable) required action C.1 is to close or isolate MBFP <br />discharge valve within 72 hours and C.2 verify MBFP discharge valve is closed or <br />isolated once per 7 days. As a result of discovering on March 7, 2016, that MBFP <br />discharge valve BFD-2-21 would not close and that would not haVe closed upon demand due <br />to a failed torque switch, TS 3.7:3 Condition C was not met. Valve BFD-2-21-was last <br />demonstrated operable on December 5, 2015, when there was a reactor trip and no <br />reported issue with valve closure. <br />NRC FORM 366AU.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(01-2014) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />FACILITY NAME (1) DOCKET (2) LER NUMBER (6) PAGE (3) <br />YEAR <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER  <br />REVISION <br />NUMBER <br />Indian Point Unit 2  05000-247  2016 	 003 	 00 4 OF 4 <br />NARRATIVE (If more space is required, use additional copies of NRC Form 366A) (17) <br />There was no safety system functional failure reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v). <br />The MBFP discharge valve BFD-2-22 for the 22 MBFP was operable and isolation of Main FW <br />from the 21 MBFP could have been accomplished in accordance with TS Basis 3.7.3.a by <br />closure of the Main FW Regulating Valves (MFRVs), trip of the MBFPs, and the closure of <br />all four Low Flow Main FW Bypass Valves (FBVs). <br />Past Similar Events <br />A review was performed of the past three years of Licensee Event Reports (LERs) for <br />events reporting a TS violation due to inoperable MBFPs. No LERs were identified. <br />Safety Significance <br />This event had no effect on the health and safety of the public. There were no actual <br />safety consequences for the event because there were no accidents or events during the <br />degraded condition. <br />Isolation of the main FW system is necessary to mitigate accident and transient <br />conditions [Main Steam Line Breaks (SLB), SG Tube Ruptures, and Excessive Heat Removal <br />Due to FW System Malfunction]. Main FW must be isolated to prevent excessive reactor <br />coolant system cooldown, containment overpressure, and steam line overfill. Main FW <br />isolation is initiated by either an Engineered Safety Feature Actuation System (ESFAS) <br />safety injection (SI) signal or a high steam generator water level signal. Main FW <br />isolation to all four SGs is provided by either 1) Closure of all four main FW <br />regulating valves (MFRVs) and all four Low Flow Main FW Bypass Valves (FBVs), or 2) <br />Closure of both MBFP discharge valves which initiates closure of all eight FW Isolation <br />Valves (MFIVs), and the trip of both MBFPs. Either of these combinations is capable of <br />achieving main FW isolation to all four SGs within the time limits assumed in the <br />accident analysis. If all eight valves referenced in item 1 close, main FW isolation <br />to all four SGs is completed within time limits that satisfy accident analysis <br />assumptions. To establish redundancy for main FW isolation safety function, the SI <br />ESFAS or High SG Level signal also provides a direct signal- that closes the two MBFP <br />discharge valves. When both MBFP discharge valves move off the open seat, the relay <br />actuates and generates a signal that initiates closure of the four main FW isolation <br />valves (MFIVs) and the four Low Flow FIVs. For this event, all FW isolation <br />capabilities were operable except the 22 MBFP discharge valve BFD-2-21. This event was <br />bounded by the analyzed event described in FSAR Section 14.1.10, (Excessive Heat <br />Removal Due to Feedwater System Malfunctions). Excessive FW additions is an analyzed <br />event postulated to occur from a malfunction of the FW control system or an operator <br />error which results in the opening of a FW control valve. The analysis assumes one FW <br />valve opens fully resulting in the excessive FW flow to one SG. For the FW system <br />malfunction at full power, the FW flow resulting from a fully open control valve is <br />terminated by the SG high level signal that closes all FW control valves and trips the <br />MBFPs. The SG high water level signal also produces a signal to trip the main turbine <br />which initiates a reactor trip. The analysis for all cases of the excessive FW <br />addition initiated at full power conditions with and without automatic rod control, <br />show that the minimum DNBR remains above the applicable safety analysis DNBR limit. In <br />the case of excessive FW flow with the reactor at zero power, the resulting transient <br />is similar to, but less severe than the hypothetical steamline break transient and is <br />bounded by the analysis in UFSAR Section 14.2.5 (Rupture of a Steam Pipe).<br /></span>
