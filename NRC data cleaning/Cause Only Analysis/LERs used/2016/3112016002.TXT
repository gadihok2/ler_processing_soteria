Power had been reduced at the beginning <br />of dayshift to support a 500 KV transmission line outage. The reactor trip was due to a Main Turbine trip caused by a Main <br />Generator Protection signal initiated by a main generator automatic voltage regulator (AVR) volts/hertz over excitation protection <br />relay. All emergency core cooling systems and emergency safeguards feature systems functioned as expected. As found calibration <br />data for the generator protection logic relay were found out of specification low. An evaluation determined the cause of the event to <br />be that the organization failed to develop and implement corrective actions to resolve the previously identified cause of poor <br />manufacturing/vendor quality identified in the causal evaluation following a similar Unit I trip on 12/21/2012 trip due to STV-1 <br />relay setpoint drift. <br />This report is being made in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73 (a)(2)(iv)(A.), "Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic <br />actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(13)," specifically automatic actuation of the Reactor Protection System and <br />the Auxiliary Peedwater System for this event. <br />NRC FORM 366 (04-2017) <br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.govireading-rm/doc-collections/nuregsistaff/sr10221r3/)  <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 03/31/2020 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

At 07:00, Salem Unit 2 commenced a load reduction at 30% per <br />hour to approximately 73% rated thermal power (RTP) to support a 500 kV line outage. Power was stabilized at <br />approximately 74% RTP at 07:50. <br />DESCRIPTION OF OCCURRRENCE <br />On 2/4/16 at 11:21 Salem Unit 2 automatically tripped from approximately 74% power on Generator Protection, initiated by <br />the main generator Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR) STVlvolts/hertz relay {TB/RLY}. At 11:20:36 Overhead <br />Annunciator (OHA) H21 — "Generator Voltage/Frequency High" was received, followed by OHA H27 — "Gen Vreg Trbl" at <br />11:21:19. At 11:21:25 OHA F47 — "Generator Protection" was received, coincident with the Unit 2 trip. <br />The STV1 relay is an over excitation protection relay. Troubleshooting identified the STV1 as a contributor to the trip, so <br />the calibration of the relay was checked. The as-found calibration data showed that the relay pick up setting was out of <br />specification low. <br />In the time period just prior to the Unit 2 trip, the generator was operating at approximately 26.1 KV, which corresponds to <br />a 2.175 V/Hz sensed at the STV1 relay. The as found pick up for the STV1 relay was at 2.17 V/Hz, so the plant was <br />operating above the relay's pick up set point. Once the set point was exceeded, the 1-121 OHA alarm was received in the <br />Control Room. After the time delay of 45 seconds had elapsed, the trip relay picked up, starting the sequence of tripping <br />the AVR on an external trip and dropping the generator field, causing the turbine trip on generator protection. The turbine <br />trip resulted in a reactor scram. <br />The Unit 2 AVR was rep'aced during the 2R21 refueling outage in Fall 2015. The STV1 was original plant design. A new <br />relay was purchased, calibrated, and installed at the time of the AVR replacement. <br />A four-hour NRC Event Notification (EN) was required by 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(iv)(B) for actuation of the reactor protection <br />system (RPS) when the reactor is critical and an eight-hour NRC EN was required by 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A) for a valid <br />actuation of the auxiliary feedwater system. EN 51708 was completed at 13:33 on 02/04/2016. This LER is being <br />submitted pursuant to the requirements of 10CFR50.73 (a)(2)(iv)(A), "Any event or condition that resulted in manual or <br />automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B)." <br />NRC FORM 365A (04-2017) 	 Page 	 2 	 of 	 4 <br />05000- 311 <br />NRC FORM 360A (04-2017) Page 3 	 of 	 4 <br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.govireading-nn/doc-collections/nurags/staff/sr1022/r3/)   <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 03/31/2020 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

DOCKET NUMBER <br />REV <br />NO. <br />01 <br />NARRATIVE <br />CAUSE OF EVENT <br />The generator trip, and subsequent automatic reactor trip, was initiated by the main generator automatic voltage regulator <br />(AVR) STV1 volts/hertz over excitation protection relay. This relay tripped at a volts/hertz level less than the design set <br />point (104.5% vs. 110%) during voltage manipulations to support a line outage. Failure analysis identified the cause of the <br />trip as damage to the R14 rheostat on the STV1 relay card. This damage is attributable to either poor manufacturing <br />quality or inadequate shipping and handling. This rheostat directly controls the set point at which the STV relay will trip for <br />over excitation protection. This defect caused the relay to trip prior to its design value. The STV-1 relay could not be <br />adjusted to within the manufacturer's acceptance criteria (+/-1%) with the failed R14 rheostat. <br />The organization failed to develop and implement corrective actions to resolve the previously identified cause of poor <br />manufacturing/vendor quality identified in the causal evaluation following a similar Unit 1 trip on 12/21/2012 trip due to <br />STV-1 relay setpoint drift. <br />SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS <br />The generator protection schemes serve as asset protection for the generator, main power transformers, and main <br />turbine. The generator over excitation protection scheme is accomplished by four GE STV relays set to protect two zones <br />of protection. Two of the four relays are set to trip at 110% and the other two at 118% of generator voltage. During an <br />over excitation condition when the generator voltage is over 110% or 118%, an external trip is sent to the voltage regulator <br />which ultimately results in a generator trip. There is a backup relay for every protection setting in order to prevent <br />inadvertent damage to the generator or transformers in the event that there is an undetected failed relay during an over-<br />voltage condition. When the GE Alterrex voltage regulator was replaced with the ABB Unitrol automatic voltage regulator, <br />the existing generator over excitation protection scheme (i.e., original design) was maintained and the same settings were <br />used based on the over excitation relays coordination analysis. <br />There were no safety consequences as a result of this event. All emergency core cooling systems (ECCS) and <br />emergency safeguard feature (ESF) systems functioned as expected. No equipment was damaged as a result of the <br />event. The plant was stabilized in Mode 3 with decay heat removal via the main steam dump valves and auxiliary feed <br />water system. Condenser vacuum remained available for decay heat removal. <br />SAFETY SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL FAILURE <br />A review of this event determined that a safety system functional failure (SSFF) did not occur as defined in NEI 99 02, <br />Regulatory Assessment Performance Indicator Guidelines. <br />PREVIOUS EVENTS <br />A review of previous events identified one that occurred in December 2012 which was caused by relay set point drift. <br />This event was reported in LER 272/2012-005. <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(04-2017) <br />1.
