Trip of 22 SGFP initiated emergency <br />safeguard feature (ESF) actuation for start of the 21 and 22 Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) Pumps. This <br />event occurred during Unit 2 start-up following a unit trip from generator protection. <br />The digital feedwater control system (DFCS) {SJ/DCC} indicated a trip on overspeed. Review of the Plant <br />Computer and the Control Console did not indicate an overspeed trip. <br />SGFP speed lowered during the swap from heating steam to main steam. SGFP condensate flow <br />momentarily decreased, causing an increase in steam demand to 22 SGFP. At 08:27:17 22 SGFP speed <br />rapidly increased from 2170 to 2450 RPM. The sudden increase in SGFP speed appears to be coincident <br />with opening of the poppet valve, allowing a sudden increase in steam supply to 22 SGFP. Data <br />downloaded from the digital feedwater control system showed a 400 RPM speed increase occurred in 300 <br />milliseconds with all three speed pick up relays indicating a overspeed rate change trip (SGFP acceleration <br />rate trip). 22 SGFP speed slows from 2450 to < 300 RPM due to a SGFP trip as indicated from the digital <br />feedwater control system. No other spikes in SGFP speed were observed in the digital feedwater control <br />system, the Plant Computer or on the associated Control Console during this event. <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />02-2014) 	<br />.. <br />it hours. <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 01/31/2017 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 <br />Reported lessons learned are incorporated into the licensing process and fed back <br />to industry.

PAGE <br />Salem Generating Station - Unit 2 05000311 <br />YEAR SEQUENTIAL NUMBER <br />REVISION <br />NUMBER <br />3 OF 4 <br />2016 	 - 004 	 - 000 <br />The DFCS design change package (DCP) was implemented during the Fall 2015 refueling outage. The rate <br />trip is a new trip added during the DFCS DCP. The SGFP acceleration rate trip is incorporated as standard <br />protection as part of the DFCS speed detection module. The setting is currently at maximum value allowed <br />by the module. This trip is anticipatory to an overspeed condition. <br />This report is being made in accordance with 10CFR50.73 (a)(2)(iv)(A), "Any event or condition that resulted <br />in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B)," for this event <br />actuation of the Auxiliary Feedwater System. Notification of this event was provided via ENS report 51738. <br />CAUSE OF EVENT <br />The 22 SGFP trip was a rate trip (-400 RPM increase in 300milliseconds) caused when the main steam <br />poppet valve opened. A root cause evaluation was conducted for this event. <br />The evaluation determined that one root cause was that the specification agreed upon by PSEG and the <br />DFCS vendor did not identify the acceleration rate trip that was incorporated into the digital feed modification. An <br />independent Critical Digital Review (CDR) was performed by an experienced independent vendor. The CDR did not <br />identify the installation of the trip. The vendor was involved in the process throughout the entire lifecycle, from <br />requirements definition to factory acceptance testing. The design requirements/specifications as defined by PSEG <br />for the implementation of the modification did not identify the acceleration rate trip. The DFCS vendor was contacted <br />and requested to validate that the acceleration rate trip was not discussed in the Functional requirements document. <br />The response to the inquiry was 'The Trip on acceleration is NOT required; therefore it is not contained in the <br />Functional Requirements Document" The trip function was installed without knowledge by engineering and the <br />vendor had documentation identifying function/trip did exist, but did not specifically communicate the existence or <br />functionality of the specific trip function. The acceleration rate trip will be removed from the system in accordance <br />with the design change process. <br />A second root cause identified was that the instructions for swapping from low pressure steam to high <br />pressure steam provided in the procedure utilized did not include a conservative description/method for <br />implementing a change in steam supply source to minimize speed perturbation. A review of data collected <br />from the event was performed. The speed and demand signals specific to this event indicated a delta from <br />previous start ups and a speed perturbation was experienced. The feed pump operation was performed within <br />the requirements of the procedure and the review performed by this evaluation indicates that this was not the <br />conservative method to operate/perform the transition from heating steam (HS) to main steam (MS). <br />Additional guidance is required to prevent further speed perturbations. <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(02-2014) <br />vR <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 01/31/2017 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection newest. 80 <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />hours.
