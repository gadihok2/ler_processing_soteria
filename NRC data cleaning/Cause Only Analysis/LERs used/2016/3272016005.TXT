Surveillance Requirement 3.6.8.1 requires greater than or equal to 33 ignitors energized in each <br />train. With the breaker open, there were less than 33 ignitors operable. Technical Specification (TS) 3.6.8, <br />Hydrogen Mitigation System (HMS), Condition A was entered. At 0916 EDT, June 7, 2016, the breaker was <br />closed restoring operability to the two hydrogen ignitors and TS 3.6.8 Condition A was exited. A past <br />operability evaluation, determined that the breaker panel associated with the two ignitors was last accessed <br />on March 11, 2016, as part of the performance of a work order. It is assumed that the breaker became <br />aligned to the open position during this work. Therefore, one train of the HMS was inoperable for longer than <br />allowed by TSs. However, Train B HMS remained operable during this event. <br />The cause for the breaker being in the open position is indeterminate. Corrective actions include issuing <br />information to Operations and Maintenance personnel regarding the !earnings from this event and the need <br />for a questioning attitude while supporting troubleshooting and maintenance activities. <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />1.

PLANT OPERATING CONDITIONS BEFORE THE EVENT <br />At the time of the event, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Unit 1 was in Mode 1 at 100 percent rated <br />thermal power. <br />II. DESCRIPTION OF EVENTS <br />A. Event: <br />On June 7, 2016, at 0914 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), main control room (MCR) operators <br />were notified by workers, in the field, that a breaker [EllS: BKR] associated with two A train <br />hydrogen ignitors was discovered in the open position. Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.6.8.1 <br />requires greater than or equal to 33 ignitors energized in each train. With the breaker open, <br />there were less than 33 of 34 ignitors operable. Technical Specification (TS) 3.6.8, Hydrogen <br />Mitigation System (HMS) [EllS: BB], Condition A was entered. <br />MCR operators verified that no configuration checklists or clearances configured the breaker to <br />the open position and directed a worker to close the breaker. At 0916 EDT, June 7, 2016, the <br />breaker was closed restoring operability to the two hydrogen ignitors and TS 3.6.8 Condition A <br />was exited. <br />A past operability evaluation completed on June 20, 2016, determined that on March 8, 2016, <br />Unit 1 entered TS 3.6.8, Condition A for a failure associated with the A train HMS. On <br />March 11, 2016, Unit 1 exited TS 3.6.8, Condition A by crediting post maintenance testing <br />following work on the A train HMS. The work performed on March 11, 2016, was the last record <br />of personnel accessing the A train HMS distribution panel. March 11, 2016, is assumed to be <br />the time of breaker misalignment. Therefore, there is no time when 33 or more A train hydrogen <br />ignitors were known to be operable between March 8, 2016 and June 7, 2016. <br />TS 3.6.8, Condition A, Required Action A.1 allows seven days to restore an inoperable HMS train <br />to operable status or Required Action A.2 allows SR 3.6.8.1 to be performed once per 7 days on <br />the operable train. TS 3.6.8, Condition C requires the unit to be in MODE 3 within 6 hours if <br />Required Action and associated Completion Time are not met. Because one train of the HMS <br />was inoperable for 91 days without completing Required Action A.1, A.2, or C.1, this is a <br />condition prohibited by TS and is therefore being reported in accordance with <br />10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), as any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's <br />Technical Specifications. <br />B. Status of structures, components, or systems that were inoperable at the start of the event <br />and contributed to the event: <br />No inoperable structures, components, or systems contributed to this event. <br />Page 2 of 6 <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />1.

Dates and approximate times of occurrences: <br />Date/Time (EDT) Description <br />03/08/16, 1027 Unit 1 entered TS 3.6.8 Condition A for failure of the A train hydrogen <br />ignitors. <br />03/11/16 Work was performed on the A train HMS distribution panel and this is <br />assumed to be when the breaker became misaligned to the open position. <br />06/07/16, 0914 Workers notified MCR operators that a breaker associated with two A train <br />hydrogen ignitors was discovered to be open. MCR operators determined <br />that less than 33 required hydrogen ignitors were operable and Unit 1 <br />entered Condition A of TS 3.6.8. <br />06/07/16, 0916 MCR operators verified that no configuration checklists or clearances <br />configured the breaker to the open position and directed a worker to close <br />the breaker to restore operability to the two A train hydrogen ignitors. <br />Unit 1 exits Condition A of TS 3.6.8. <br />D. Manufacturer and model number of each component that failed during the event: <br />There was no component that failed. <br />E. Other systems or secondary functions affected: <br />There were no other systems or secondary functions affected by this event. <br />F. Method of discovery of each component or system failure or procedural error: <br />MCR operators were notified by workers, in the field, that a breaker associated with two A train <br />hydrogen ignitors was discovered in the open position. <br />G. The failure mode, mechanism, and effect of each failed component, if known: <br />There was no component that failed. <br />H. Operator actions: <br />Following notification of the issue to the MCR operators, it was determined that less than 33 <br />ignitors were operable, and Unit 1 entered TS 3.6.8, Condition A. MCR operators verified that no <br />configuration checklists or clearances configured the breaker to the open position and directed a <br />worker to close the breaker and restore operability to the two A train hydrogen ignitors. <br />I.

CAUSE OF THE EVENT <br />A. The cause of each component or system failure or personnel error, if known: <br />The cause of the breaker being in the open position was indeterminate. The most likely cause <br />was inadvertent bumping or jarring by workers in the area following post maintenance testing on <br />March 11, 2016. <br />B. The cause(s) and circumstances for each human performance related root cause: <br />There was no identified human performance related root cause. <br />IV. ANALYSIS OF THE EVENT <br />The Hydrogen Mitigation System causes hydrogen in containment to burn in a controlled <br />manner as it accumulates following a degraded core accident. Burning occurs at the lower <br />flammability concentration, where the resulting temperatures and pressures are relatively <br />benign. Without the system, hydrogen could build up to higher concentrations that could result <br />in a violent reaction if ignited by random ignition source after such a buildup. <br />The hydrogen ignitors are not included for mitigation of a Design Basis Accident (DBA). <br />However, the HMS is included in the Technical Specifications because it has been shown by <br />probabilistic risk analysis to be a significant contributor to limiting the severity of accident <br />sequences that are commonly found to dominate risk for units with ice condenser <br />containments. <br />Operation with at least one HMS train ensures that the hydrogen in containment can be burned in a <br />controlled manner. All B train hydrogen ignitors were operable for the duration in which the A train <br />was inoperable. <br />V. 	 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES <br />Based on the above Analysis of Event, the health and safety of the public were not adversely <br />affected by this event. <br />A. Availability of systems or components that could have performed the same function as the <br />components and systems that failed during the event: <br />There were no components that failed during this event. During this event, the B train of <br />the HMS was operable. <br />B. For events that occurred when the reactor was shut down, availability of systems or <br />components needed to shutdown the reactor and maintain safe shutdown conditions, <br />remove residual heat, control the release of radioactive material, or mitigate the <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />1.

For failure that rendered a train of a safety system inoperable, an estimate of the elapsed <br />time from discovery of the failure until the train was returned to service: <br />The elapsed time from discovery of the A train HMS being inoperable until the train was restored <br />to operable status was approximately one minute. <br />VI. 	 CORRECTIVE ACTIONS <br />This event was entered into the Tennessee Valley Authority Corrective Action Program under <br />Condition Report (CR) 1179126. <br />A. Immediate Corrective Actions: <br />MCR operators verified that no configuration checklists or clearances configured the <br />breaker to the open position and directed a worker to close the breaker and restore <br />operability to the two A train hydrogen ignitors. <br />B. Corrective actions to reduce probability of similar events occurring in the future: <br />Corrective actions include re-verifying breakers associated with the HMS are in the correct <br />alignment and issuing information to Operations and Maintenance personnel regarding the <br />!earnings from this event and the need for a questioning attitude while supporting <br />troubleshooting and maintenance activities. <br />VII. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION <br />A. Previous similar events at the same plant: <br />There have been no previous similar events at SQN in the past three years. <br />B. Additional Information: <br />None. <br />C. Safety System Functional Failure Consideration: <br />This condition did not result in a safety system functional failure. <br />D. Scrams with Complications Consideration: <br />There was no scram associated with this event. <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />1. FACILITY NAME 6. LER NUMBER 2.
