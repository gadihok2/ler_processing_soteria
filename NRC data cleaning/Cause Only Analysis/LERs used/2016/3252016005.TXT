These cables <br />are susceptible to thermally induced current (TIC), which can degrade the accuracy of DWHRRMs. The <br />review resulted in DWHRRMs being declared inoperable on both units. The DWHRRMs were included in <br />Technical Specifications (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.3.3.1 beginning in 1984. As a result <br />of the TIC effect on the DWHRRM cables, BSEP Unit 1 and Unit 2 have operated longer than the TS <br />allowed completion times for inoperable DWHRRMs. This event is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) <br />as a condition prohibited by the plant TSs. The event resulted from the inherent characteristics of the cables <br />and DWHRRMs. An existing site procedure directs the use of alternate indications for assessment of drywell <br />or fuel cladding conditions, and this procedure will remain in place as a compensatory action. Corrective <br />actions will include replacing the cables on a schedule to be developed after assessment of available <br />options. <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016) <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(06-2016)) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.00v/readino-rm/doc-collections/nureqs/staff/sr1022/r3/)  <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

No out-of-service equipment contributed to, or affected the course of, this event. <br />Reportability Criteria <br />This event is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) because Units 1 and 2 were <br />operated in a condition prohibited by the Technical Specifications (TS). Specifically, both units' Drywell <br />High Range Radiation Monitors (DWHRRMs) [IP] were declared inoperable due to signal cables which <br />can degrade the accuracy of the DWHRRMs. With the DWHRRMs inoperable, a Special Report should <br />have been submitted to the NRC within 14 days per TS 3.3.3.1, Condition F. The requirement to submit a <br />Special Report has been in effect since 1984 following issuance of License Amendments 73 and 99 for <br />Units 1 and 2, respectively. The Special Report was not submitted because the DWHRRMs were not <br />previously recognized as inoperable. Therefore, the plant was operated in a condition prohibited by the <br />TS. In accordance with 10 CFR 50.4(e), this event is being reported by LER only, and a Special Report is <br />not required. <br />Event Description  <br />On October 3, 2016, Engineering personnel were re-assessing signal cables for the DWHRRMs. These <br />cables are susceptible to a phenomenon known as thermally induced current (TIC). During transient <br />conditions, TIC can result in connected radiation monitors temporarily not meeting the accuracy <br />requirements of Regulatory Guide (RG) 1.97, Revision 2, "Instrumentation for Light-Water-Cooled Nuclear <br />Power Plants to Assess Plant and Environs Conditions During and Following an Accident." Per RG 1.97, <br />Table 1, note 7, DWHRRMs must be accurate to within a factor of 2. The cables installed in both units at <br />BSEP were previously assumed to be bounded by analysis of Rockbestos cables addressed in Electric <br />Power Research Institute (EPRI) Technical Report 110379, "High Range Radiation Monitor Cable Study: <br />Phase 1." It was assumed that the materials in use at BSEP have essentially the same dielectric properties <br />and thermal response as those tested by EPRI. Based on the reported behavior of those materials, <br />calculations predicted that TIC-induced inaccuracy in the DWHRRMs at BSEP would not result in <br />significant impact. <br />Re-assessment of the previous analysis at BSEP cast doubt on the earlier conclusion. The BSEP cables <br />use an insulation material that was not tested by EPRI, and no rigorous basis supported the assumption <br />that the dielectric properties and thermal response would be the same. Engineering personnel, therefore, <br />determined that the previous conclusion about the acceptability of cables used at BSEP lacked sufficiently <br />rigorous justification. This was reported to Operations personnel via Condition Report 2066681. Both BSEP <br />Unit and Unit 2 DWHRRMs were conservatively declared inoperable. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 2 of 4 <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(06-2016)) <br />O LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />9*, 	 CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.a_ov/readinci-rm/doc-collections/nurecis/staff/sr1022/r3/)  <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

The TIC phenomenon was made known <br />to the nuclear power industry via NRC Information Notice 97-45, Supplement 1, "Environmental <br />Qualification Deficiency for Cables and Containment Penetration Pigtails." BSEP's initial assessment <br />concluded that the effect of TIC upon the DWHRRMs was too small to appreciably affect their <br />performance in a design basis accident. A new review cast doubt on that conclusion because <br />documentation of the initial assessment contained no rigorous basis for the assumption that BSEP's <br />cables were bounded by those tested by EPRI. Therefore, the DWHRRMs were conservatively declared <br />inoperable. <br />Safety Assessment <br />The purpose of the DWHRRMs is to provide operators with indication of radiation conditions inside the <br />primary containment following an accident. Radiation conditions, in turn, are used to assess the integrity <br />of the fuel cladding and provide input for emergency action levels (EALs) to classify a plant emergency. <br />The affected monitors would continue to function despite their susceptibility to TIC, but could indicate <br />radiation levels higher than actual if cables were exposed to increasing temperatures, or lower than actual <br />if cables were exposed to decreasing temperatures. Radiation indications would be inaccurate only during <br />times when temperature in the drywell was rapidly changing. When temperature changes in the drywell <br />grew smaller or stopped, inaccuracy in the DWHRRMs would diminish or vanish entirely. During times <br />when the accuracy of the DWHRRMs might appear questionable, alternative methods of assessing the <br />condition of the fuel are available to operators as provided in existing plant procedure OPLP-37, <br />"Equipment Important to Emergency Preparedness and ERO Response." The DWHRRMs do not control <br />any other structures, systems, or components. <br />Based on this analysis, this event had no adverse impact on the health and safety of the public. <br />Corrective Actions  <br />Any changes to the corrective actions and schedules noted below will be made in accordance with the <br />site's corrective action program. <br />An already-existing site procedure, OPLP-37 (referenced above), provides alternate indications for the <br />DWHRRMs for assessment of drywell or fuel cladding conditions. This procedure will remain in place as a <br />preplanned alternate method until a permanent resolution is implemented. <br />The subject cables will be replaced with cables less susceptible to TIC. The replacement schedule will be <br />developed following assessment of available options. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 3 of 4 <br />‘.„(fAl LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.gpv/readincl-rm/doc-collections/nureds/staff/sr1022/r3/)  <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(06-2016)) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.
