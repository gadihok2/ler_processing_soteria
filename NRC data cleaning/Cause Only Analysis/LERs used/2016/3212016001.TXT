A refueling interlock <br />of the main grapple was encountered while moving a double blade guide, caused by the disconnection of 20 Rod Position <br />Information System (RPIS) Position Indicating Probes (PIPs). The operating crew began troubleshooting and determined <br />that bypassing the RPIS probe "full-in" would clear the interlock. However the crew used a section of the site specific <br />procedure for control rod withdrawal during refuel that wasn't applicable at the time. <br />The RPIS indications were bypassed and the movement of the double blade guide was recommenced at 12:00 followed <br />by fuel movement. After a review of Technical Specifications 3.9.4, it was determined that fuel movement should not be <br />performed with the RPIS probe disconnected and bypassed because the associated control rods were not disarmed with <br />a tagout. Fuel movement activities were then halted. <br />NRC FORM 366 (02-2014) <br />1. FACILITY NAME 3. PAGE 2. DOCKET 6.

Hatch Nuclear Plant Unit 1 05000 321 2 OF 3 <br />YEAR SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />REV. <br />NO. <br />2016 -- 001 -- 00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />PLANT AND SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION <br />General Electric- Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) <br />Energy Industry Identification System codes appear in the text as (EIIS Code XX) <br />DESCRIPTION OF EVENT <br />On 02/11/16, during the Hatch 1R27 outage, fuel movement activities were halted, due to a faulty grapple camera. Once <br />the camera was fixed, the fuel movement activities recommenced. After a couple of minutes, the operator was unable to <br />lower a blade guide into the core. It was discovered that a refueling interlock of the main grapple was encountered. This <br />had occurred because 20 Rod Position Indication System (RPIS) Position Indicating Probes (PIPs) had been <br />disconnected. The work to remove the PIPs was authorized by the Work Release Supervisor and the Unit 1 Shift <br />Supervisor, out of sequence. <br />The RPIS indications were bypassed and the blade guide was lowered into the core followed by continuing fuel movement. <br />After a review of Technical Specification 3.9.4, Control Rod Position Indication, it was determined that fuel movement <br />should not be performed with the RPIS probe disconnected and bypassed because the associated control rods were not <br />hydraulically disarmed by closing the drive water and exhaust water isolation valves in accordance with the Technical <br />Specification Bases. Fuel movement was then halted. The Unit 1 Shift Supervisor instructed the PIPs to be reinstalled. <br />The PIPs were installed, RPIS full-in bypass box switches for all rods (20) were un-bypassed and the fuel movement <br />activities were resumed. <br />CAUSE OF EVENT <br />The cause of moving fuel while the RPIS "full-in" indication was inoperable was due to inadequate procedure usage. The <br />operations Shift Manager also became involved in troubleshooting and did not maintain an oversight role. This contributed <br />to a misinterpretation of technical specifications, leading to the inappropriate decision to bypass the (20) RPIS full-in <br />indications prior to commencing fuel movement. <br />REPORTABILITY ANALYSIS AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT <br />This event is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation or condition prohibited by Technical <br />Specifications (TS) 3.9.4 which prohibits performing fuel movement when one or more required control rod position <br />indication channels are inoperable. <br />Refueling equipment interlocks restrict the operation of the refueling equipment or the withdrawal of control rods to <br />reinforce unit procedures that prevent the reactor from potentially achieving criticality during refueling. The refueling <br />interlock circuitry senses the conditions of the refueling equipment and the control rods. Depending on the sensed <br />conditions, interlocks are actuated to prevent the operation of the refueling equipment or the withdrawal of control rods. <br />NRC FORM 366A .:1-2001: <br />NRC FORM 366A (02-2014) <br />1.

Hatch Nuclear Plant Unit 1 05000 321 3 OF 3 <br />YEAR SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />REV. <br />NO. <br />2016 -- 001 -- 00 <br />NRC FORM 366A (1-2001) <br />NRC FORM 366A (02-2014) <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(02-2014) LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />NARRATIVE <br />The disconnection of the RPIS PIPs did not result in any damage to safety related equipment, offsite radiological <br />releases, or personnel injuries. The Control Rod Drive Pumps had been stopped, thus preventing any potential control <br />rod movement by removing the motive force. The control rods were therefore effectively hydraulically disarmed but not <br />as suggested by the Tech Spec Bases 3.9.4 by closing the drive water and exhaust water isolation valves. Even though <br />this condition was contrary to Tech Spec requirements, no change in reactivity resulted and no movement of the control <br />rods occurred. Based on this information this reported condition had very low safety significance. <br />CORRECTIVE ACTIONS  <br />Immediately following the event fuel movement was halted and the PIPS were installed. Qualifications were withdrawn <br />for the personnel involved and a "stand down" was held with the Operations department where emphasis was stated on <br />the importance of remaining in assigned roles. <br />Operations training will be presented using this event as operating experience during license training prior to the next <br />refueling outage. Special focus will be placed on the technical specifications that apply during this evolution, the <br />importance of staying within roles, and avoidance of making decisions driven by schedule concerns. Operations training <br />will also perform specific pre-outage training on non-routine tasks (including control rod manipulations and fuel removal) <br />prior to the next refueling outage. <br />ADDITIONAL INFORMATION  <br />Other Systems Affected: None. <br />Failed Components Information: None. <br />Commitment Information: This report does not created any new licensing commitments. <br />Previous Similar Events: <br />LER 2012-001-0 <br />On 2/25/2012, with the unit in Mode 5 for refueling, the "full-in" indication for Control Rod (CR) 22-27 was noted to be <br />inoperable, and a required action statement (RAS) for TS 3.9.4 was entered. In accordance with the RAS the control <br />room staff visually verified that the CR was fully inserted, action was taken to electrically disarm the associated CR drive, <br />and a tag-out was conducted as part of the disarming action. A modified probe buffer card was installed to bypass the <br />"full-in" indication signal in order to remove the rod block. Notation of the use of the modified probe buffer card was <br />added to an existing TS RAS to track its installation and loss of the RPIS indication. At 2121 EST on 2/28/2012, the tag-<br />out described above was cleared (i.e., removed) without removing the modified probe buffer card and without performing <br />a functional test of the "full-in" indication prior to moving fuel in the reactor vessel. Fuel movement occurred from the time <br />the tag-out was removed until 0817 EST on 3/212012 when the error was discovered; resulting in a condition prohibited <br />by TS for CR position indication. The cause of this event was attributed to less than adequate procedural controls and <br />the failure of involved personnel to effectively "self-check" as a human error prevention technique. A procedure change <br />was implemented to require the shift supervisor to sign a tag-out if used to comply with a TS requirement. Because the <br />lack of a tagout was cited in the 2016 event, the corrective actions from the 2012 event would not be expected to have <br />prevented the condition reported in this LER. <br />NRC FORM 366A (02-2014)<br /></span>
