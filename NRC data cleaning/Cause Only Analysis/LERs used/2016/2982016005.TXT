If a <br />means used to impose an information collection does not display a currently valid OMB control <br />number, the NRC may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, the <br />information collection. <br />NARRATIVE <br />PLANT STATUS <br />Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS) was in Mode 5, Refueling, at 0 percent power, at the time of the events. <br />BACKGROUND <br />On January 15, 2016, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued Enforcement Guidance Memorandum <br />(EGM) 11-003, Revision 3, "Dispositioning Boiling Water Reactor Licensee Noncompliance with <br />Technical Specification Containment Requirements During Operations with a Potential for Draining the <br />Reactor Vessel." EGM 11-003, Revision 3, provides generic enforcement discretion to allow <br />implementation of specific interim actions as an alternative to full compliance with plant technical <br />specifications related to Secondary Containment operability during Mode 5 Operations with a Potential <br />for Draining the Reactor Vessel (OPDRV) activities. To ensure compliance with interim actions specified <br />in the EGM, CNS added guidance to plant Procedure 0.50.5, "Outage Shutdown Safety." <br />EVENT DESCRIPTION <br />During Refueling Outage 29 (RE-29), CNS implemented the guidance of EGM 11-003, Revision 3, four <br />times. Consistent with EGM 11-003, Revision 3, Secondary Containment operability was not maintained <br />during OPDRV activities, and Required Action C.2 of Technical Specification (TS) 3.6.4.1 was not <br />completed. <br />The following provides the dates which EGM 11-003 was implemented: <br />1. On October 1 and 2, 2016, the EGM was utilized to allow work on Reactor Recirculation Pump A <br />(RR-P-A) and RR-P-B without the jet pump plugs installed while performing Surveillance Procedure <br />6.1SGT.401, "SGT A Fan Capacity Test, SGT B Cooling Flow Test and Check Valve 1ST (Div 1)." <br />2. From October 2-5, 2016, the EGM was utilized to allow work on RR-P-A, RR-P-B, Control Rod <br />Drive (CRD) withdrawal/bypass operations and Hydraulic Control Unit (HCU) 42-31 during repairs <br />to Main Steam Air Operated Valve 86B. <br />3. On October 6, 2016, the EGM was utilized to work on RR-P-A and RR-P-B without the jet pump <br />plugs installed while draining Reactor Core Isolation Cooling 12 Relief Valve and flushing Main <br />Steam Isolation Valves (MSIV). <br />4. From October 19-25, 2016, the EGM was utilized to work on RR-P-A. While using the EGM, work <br />was also performed on CRD-V-113s (freeze seal), CRD Drive Venting, and CRD-V-105 (10-43) <br />(freeze seal). These OPDRVs were in progress while Secondary Containment was inoperable for <br />MSIV 86A and 86B repair, Reactor Building (RB) personnel airlock seal repair, shift of RB <br />ventilation, Service Water Valve 531 draining and Residual Heat Removal Valve 57/67 draining. <br />Page 2 of 3 <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016) <br />Page 3 of 3 <br />NRC FORM 366 <br />	<br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-201<br />y<br />5<br />3<br />)<br />' <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />(See Page 2 for required number of digits/characters for each block) <br />(See NUREG-1022, R 3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.govireading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr10221r31)  <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours. <br />Reported lessons learned are incorporated into the licensing process and fed back to industry.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER <br />05000- 298 Cooper Nuclear Station <br />YEAR <br />2016 <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />- 005 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />- 00 <br />3. LER NUMBER <br />NARRATIVE <br />BASIS FOR REPORT <br />These events are reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as conditions prohibited by <br />CNS TS 3.6.4.1, which prohibits performing activities identified as OPDRVs in MODE 5 while secondary <br />containment is inoperable. <br />SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE <br />As discussed in EGM 11-003, Revision 3, enforcement discretion is appropriate because the issues <br />have low safety significance since licensees must implement compensatory measures to provide an <br />adequate level of safety when using the discretion. To ensure compliance with the interim actions <br />specified in the EGM, CNS added guidance to plant Procedure 0.50.5. This procedure was implemented <br />for the OPDRV activities during which Secondary Containment was not operable. <br />CAUSE <br />Implementation of EGM 11-003, Revision 3, during RE-29 was a planned activity. As such, there were <br />no root cause evaluations of the events. <br />CORRECTIVE ACTIONS <br />CNS will submit a license amendment request to adopt the Technical Specifications Task Force (TSTF) <br />traveler associated with generic resolution of this issue, within 12 months after issuance of the Notice of <br />Availability of the TSTF traveler. <br />PREVIOUS EVENTS <br />During RE-28, CNS implemented EGM 11-003, Revision 2, seven times. These events were reported <br />under one License Event Report, LER 2014-004-00. <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016)<br /></span>
