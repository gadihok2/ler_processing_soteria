FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant (JAF) was ascending in power when screenwell water <br />level started to lower. At 89 percent power, at 22:23, Operators began taking compensatory measures to reduce power <br />and mitigate water level lowering. At 22:40, a manual scram was initiated. <br />The scram was complicated by a residual transfer that resulted in non-vital equipment trips. This event resulted in the <br />manual actuation of the Reactor Protection System, High Pressure Coolant Injection, Reactor Core Isolation Cooling, Main <br />Steam Isolation Valves and automatic actuation of Emergency Diesel Generators, Emergency Service Water, and <br />containment isolations in multiple systems, reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A). <br />The lowering screenwell water level was caused by frazil ice blockage at the intake structure. The frazil ice stopped <br />affecting screenwell water level after the manual scram. Corrective actions include strengthening mitigating actions in <br />response to frazil ice. <br />The residual transfer was caused by lubrication hardening in the lower control valve assembly of the 71PCB-10042 <br />breaker. Corrective actions included replacing or reworking the lower control valve assembly. <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />Page 2 of 6 <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 <br />	<br />EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request 80 hours.

FitzPatrick's (JAF) Ultimate Heat Sink <br />[EllS designation: BS] is Lake Ontario. Water <br />from Lake Ontario is transported via a water <br />intake structure. The intake structure is an <br />underwater concrete structure on the lakebed. <br />Lake water enters the intake structure, travels <br />through the intake tunnel, and enters the intake <br />bay. The intake bay is located inside the screen <br />house building. The enclosed intake bay area is <br />also called the screenwell. <br />Located in the screenwell area, downstream of <br />trash racks and rotating screens, are three <br />Circulating Water pumps [KE], three Normal <br />Service Water (NSW) pumps [KG], two <br />Emergency Service Water (ESW) pumps [BI], <br />four Residual Heat Removal Service Water <br />(RHRSW) pumps [BI] and two Fire pumps [KP]. <br />One Fire pump is upstream of the trash racks. <br />The Circulating Water pumps supply cooling to <br />the main condenser and are each operated at 133,000 gpm. NSW pumps are each rated at 17,800 gpm and <br />supply cooling to plant loads during normal operating conditions. ESW pumps supply cooling to safety-related <br />loads during both normal and accident conditions and are rated at 3,700 gpm each. RHRSW pumps, rated at <br />4,000 gpm each, supply cooling to the RHR heat exchangers. <br />Intake / screenwell water level is normally slightly lower than lake level due to flow head losses (generally at <br />about 244 feet elevation depending on seasonal changes). The screenwell level is monitored in the control <br />room and on Operator rounds. The NSW, ESW, and RHRSW pumps require a minimum water elevation at <br />235 feet elevation for safe operation. The Circulating Water and the Fire pumps require a minimum water <br />elevation of 239 feet 6 inches for safe operation. <br />Frazil ice is a natural phenomenon in lakes and water ways, including Lake Ontario, when water freezes into <br />loosely formed needle-like crystals. Surface water becomes supercooled when it loses heat rapidly to cold air <br />without freezing. Turbulence, caused by winds, can mix the supercooled water throughout a body of water. <br />The supercooled water encourages the formation of small ice crystals (frazil ice). Ice generally floats, but due <br />to frazil ice's small size relative to current speeds, it can be carried to the bottom very easily. Frazil ice is more <br />likely to occur when air temperatures decrease below freezing and when there is little ice cover on the lake, no <br />cloud cover, winds are present, and the sun has set. Frazil ice has a negative impact on plant operations when <br />it adheres to the intake structure. Supercooled water can reduce the intake structure surface temperatures <br />below freezing then ice forms directly on the surface or frazil ice slush could drift into the structure and adhere <br />to it. Since the intake structure actively draws in water it may draw in frazil ice. The intake structure entrance <br />includes rack bars to screen large debris, consisting of 88 metal bars. These metal bars would normally be an <br />optimal surface for frazil ice accumulation; however, deicing heaters are located in each. <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />Page 3 of 6 <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />	<br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />''G&44 <br />t• 	 LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 <br />	<br />EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request 80 hours.

During normal <br />power operations, a portion of the power created by the Main Generator [EL] becomes the Normal Service <br />power source. In the event the main generator is not available offsite power circuits are available to supply <br />plant loads. Finally, Emergency Diesel Generators (EDG) [EK] are available on standby as the emergency <br />power source. The AC power supply system is designed with transfer power schemes to maintain power to <br />Engineered Safeguards systems. <br />The fast transfer scheme triggers multiple electrical breakers in such a way that all electrical loads remain at <br />power and in-phase. Alternatively, if the fast transfer was unsuccessful or the nature of the disturbance will not <br />allow a fast transfer, an automatic residual transfer takes place. Residual transfer scheme is delayed until the <br />voltage on the affected bus has decayed to approximately 25 percent of normal; this permits reenergizing the <br />motors even though reserve and supply voltages may be out of phase. <br />Event Description <br />On January 23, 2016, JAF was ascending in power after a planned downpower to perform maintenance when <br />screenwell water level began to decrease. The initial water level in the screenwell was 243.8 feet. <br />At 21:45, screenwell water level began to gradually decrease at a rate of about 1/4 inch per minute. At that <br />time, Operators were commencing with power ascension to a reactor power level of 89 percent. <br />At 22:17, the screenwell water level low alarm was received at 242 feet, and an Operator was sent to verify <br />local indications. <br />At 22:20, AOP-56, Intake Water Level Trouble. <br />At 22:23, Reactor Water Recirculating pump speed was reduced to lower reactor power and one of three <br />Circulating Water pumps was secured. <br />At 22:28, power reached 68% and screenwell water level reached 240.7 feet. Screenwell water level <br />recovered up to 241.5 feet. <br />At 22:31, screenwell water level began to decrease again. <br />At 22:39, water level decreased to 240 feet. <br />At 22:40, a manual scram was initiated. All control rods successfully inserted. The Main Turbine [TA] / <br />Generator [TB] was manually tripped. <br />The fast transfer scheme failed and a residual transfer occurred automatically, as designed, and several plant <br />systems automatically tripped or started: <br />• Reactor Water Recirculation pumps [AD] tripped <br />• Remaining Circulating Water pumps, Feedwater [SJ], Condensate [SD], and Condensate Booster <br />pumps tripped <br />• Reactor Building Cooling [CC] and Turbine Building Cooling [KB] tripped <br />• Air System [LD] tripped <br />• EDG and ESW automatically started <br />Main Steam Isolation Valves (MSIV) were manually closed and Safety Relief Valves (SRN) [SB], High <br />Pressure Coolant Injection (HPCI) [BJ], and Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) [BN] were manually <br />actuated to maintain vessel inventory and pressure. ESW was used as the cooling water source for <br />equipment. This event was reported to the NRC by ENS 51680. <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />Page 4 of 6 <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />	<br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />''G&44 <br />t• 	 LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 <br />	<br />EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request 80 hours.

The <br />most likely location for frazil ice accumulation is the bar racks or the concrete surfaces at the intake structure. <br />Currently, there isn't a way to directly observe the formation of frazil ice in the lake until it has already begun to <br />degrade screenwell water level. Meteorological and lake conditions are monitored by Chemistry personnel for <br />susceptibility of frazil ice and, if conditions warrant it, Operators are alerted to the possibility. On the day of this <br />event, frazil ice susceptibility was addressed during shift turnover. <br />The intake structure rack bars are heated to maintain their surface temperature above freezing. If surfaces are <br />above 32 degrees no matter how slightly, ice cannot adhere to the surface. However, the concrete surfaces of <br />the intake structure itself are not heated and may provide a location for frazil ice accumulation and growth. Ice <br />build-up can still occur on the bars if the amount of supercooling exceeds the thermal margin provided by the <br />deicing heaters. The deicing heaters are not adequately sized to prevent frazil ice formation under extreme <br />supercooling conditions, although they will minimize frazil ice formation most of the time. Maintenance and <br />surveillance history of deicing heaters demonstrate that they were Operable during this event. <br />In response to lowering screenwell water level, procedure AOP-56, Intake Water Level Trouble, initiates <br />reductions in plant power and demand for the cooling water supply. Operators responded by reducing reactor <br />power and removing a Circulating Water pump. <br />Prior to this event, tempering was being used to control intake bay water temperature to 37 degrees <br />Fahrenheit. Warm discharge water can be added to intake bay by raising the tempering gate. In effect, a <br />portion of water drawn by pumps will come from the discharge flow rather than the intake structure. A higher <br />water temperature correlates with a higher tempering flow and a lower intake velocity. A lower velocity at the <br />intake structure would allow more time for the ice to float to the surface instead of being drawn into the intake <br />structure. If frazil ice blockage cannot be prevented, the rate of formation can be mitigated by reducing the <br />intake flow rate. To be successful, these actions to reduce flow rate need initiated as soon as possible. <br />Residual Transfer <br />Unrelated to frazil ice, during this event, the fast transfer scheme failed to occur when a fast transfer blocking <br />relay performed a timing function. If the fast transfer doesn't happen within a short time after a Main Generator <br />trip, the fast transfer is blocked and a residual transfer is automatically initiated. <br />Investigations performed after this event identified that indications from the line circuit breaker 71PCB-10042, <br />required for fast transfer, did not occur as expected. The indications from 71PCB-10042 breaker were delayed <br />due to the lower control valves actuating slowly. This caused the breaker failure logic to actuate. This logic in <br />turn (appropriately per design) prevented the fast transfer from occurring. Slow breaker operation is attributed <br />to degraded lubrication in the lower control valves of 71PCB-10042. Degraded lubrication is caused by <br />lubrication hardening, due to a lack of maintenance, along with cold weather and infrequent operation. <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />Pa e 5 of 6 <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />	<br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />sg.AP 	 EG,,44,..   <br />	<br />_.f - I,' 	 LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />‘,, 	 . 1111111' 	 ,F 	 CONTINUATION SHEET <br />',„, 	 & <br />* <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request 80 hours.

Frazil ice <br />mitigation strategies have proven useful at delaying its onset under slower acting events. Corrective actions <br />due to this event include strengthening Operator awareness and prolonging the onset of frazil ice: <br />• New alarm point EPIC-A-2957, high change rate of screenwell water level during potential frazil ice. <br />• Enhance OP-4, Circulating Water System. Increase intake bay water temperature tempering to a range <br />of 47 to 52 degrees Fahrenheit. Reduce power to 75% when notified by Nine Mile Point plant if they <br />have indication of intake icing. Include guidance for monitoring meteorological conditions. If frazil ice <br />potential is very high then tempering is increased to 65 degrees Fahrenheit. <br />• Enhance AOP-56, Intake Water Level Trouble. Provide instructions to increase tempering flow during <br />frazil ice events and the use of EPIC-A-2957. <br />Corrective actions for the residual transfer included: all three lower control valves for the 71PCB-10042 <br />breaker were rebuilt or replaced. <br />Safety Significance <br />There was no actual radiological or nuclear safety consequence during this event. <br />During plant power operations, when Circulating Water pumps are operating, intake velocity may be high <br />enough to draw in large masses of ice and block the intake opening. Even if a manual scram is not initiated, <br />the resulting lowered intake water level will automatically trip the Circulating Water pumps and cause an <br />automatic scram. This automatic scram occurs prior to screenwell water level lowering below what is needed <br />to run RHRSW and ESW cooling. The total flow needed for RHRSW and ESW cooling (30,000 gpm) is <br />relatively low and it is unlikely that the intake structure will be completely blocked. However, assuming <br />complete intake blockage, the screenwell has built-in provisions that make it possible for the flow in the intake <br />and discharge tunnels to be reversed. <br />During plant shutdown conditions, when the Circulating Water pumps are not normally operating, the intake <br />velocity is so low that significant frazil ice is not drawn into the intake structure. Under these conditions, the <br />heat generated by the rack bar heaters is sufficient to prevent frazil ice from adhering to them. Additionally, the <br />residence time for the water in the intake tunnel is significantly increased allowing the water to absorb more <br />heat from the ground/earth and melt any ice particles that may have passed the intake structure. <br />Even though several non-vital systems tripped, a residual transfer is designed to maintain power to <br />Engineered Safeguards systems. <br />References <br />• Condition Report: CR-JAF-2016-00243, Root Cause for Manual Scram due to Frazil Ice <br />• Condition Report: CR-JAF-2016-00244, Apparent Cause for Residual Transfer <br />• Procedure: AOP-56, Intake Water Level Trouble <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015)<br /></span>
