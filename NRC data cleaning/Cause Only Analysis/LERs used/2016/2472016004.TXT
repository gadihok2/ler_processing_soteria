As a <br />result of the inspection, 227 baffle-former bolts were identified to have either <br />visual anomalies or ultrasonic indications or could not be examined by ultrasonic <br />testing. A visual inspection of the baffle-former plates and edge bolts showed no <br />discernible material degradation or distortion. All other MRP-227-A inspections of <br />the reactor vessel internals showed no other failures or premature degradation. <br />The root cause of the failed baffle-former bolts is primarily Irradiation Assisted <br />Stress Corrosion Cracking (IASCC) in combination with applied stresses and fatigue <br />loads. Failure analyses will be conducted to confirm the cause for the degradation 	 - <br />of the baffle-former bolts. <br />At the time of discovery, the unit was in a safe and stable condition with all fuel <br />removed from the reactor vessel. The event had no impact on public health and <br />safety. <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />1. FACILITY NAME 2.

As part of the IP2 License Renewal process, Entergy <br />committed to performing inspections of the reactor vessel internal components {AB} <br />during the 2R22 refueling outage. The NRC has approved EPRI Technical Report MRP-<br />227-A, "Materials Reliability Program: Pressurized Water Reactor Internals <br />Inspection and Evaluation Guidelines," as an acceptable vehicle for performing <br />aging-related inspections and evaluations of applicable reactor components. One set <br />of components inspected under MRP-227-A were the baffle-former bolts through visual <br />inspection (VT) and ultrasonic (UT) examination. <br />The IP2'baffle structure includes 832 baffle-former bolts which attach the baffle <br />plates, to the former plates. Of the 832 baffle-former bolts, 227 either failed to <br />meet acceptance criteria or could not be UT inspected. The UT inspection identified <br />indications on 182 bolts, 14 were incapable of being UT inspected and were thus <br />conservatively assumed to have failed, and 31 bolts failed the VT. The failed <br />baffle-former bolts are distributed throughout the vertical baffle plates with more <br />failures found in the upper portion of the plates and more concentrated on some of <br />the plates than others (the failures are clustered). <br />The 227 failed bolts and the pattern of failure did not meet the acceptance criteria <br />for plant startup from the 2R22 refueling outage which had been provided by <br />Westinghouse prior to the outage in an analysis of the baffle-former assembly in <br />WCAP-18048-P. The consequence of this is that baffle-former bolt replacements were <br />required to be completed prior to returning IP2 back to service. <br />The reactor vessel (RV) {RPV} is cylindrical in shape with a hemispherical bottom <br />and a flanged and gasketed (0-rings) removable upper head. The vessel contains the <br />reactor core, the core support structures, control rod clusters {AA}, thermal <br />shield, and other components. The RV Lower Internal Assembly provides support for <br />the core and channels reactor coolant flow through the fuel assemblies {AC}. The <br />main element of the Lower Internals Assembly is the core barrel, which is a <br />cylindrical structure fabricated from welded plate that is supported at its upper <br />flange by a ledge in the RV main flange. The core barrel includes the baffle-former <br />assembly, which is bolted directly to the lower core barrel. This stainless steel <br />assembly is a bolted configuration consisting of eight (8) horizontal former plates <br />and twenty-eight (28) vertical baffle plates which provide the transition from the <br />cylindrical core barrel to a geometry that accepts rectangular fuel assemblies. The <br />assembly forms a boundary for the flow of reactor coolant and provides some lateral <br />support for the fuel assemblies for both normal and abnormal operation. The former <br />plates are bolted to the core barrel and the baffle plates are bolted to the former <br />plates with 832 baffle-former bolts. <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />Page 2 of 6 <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />1.

If a means <br />used to impose an information collection does not display a currently valid OMB control number, the <br />NRC may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, the information <br />collection. <br />2016 	 - 004 	 - 00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />The baffle-former bolts are SA-479 Type 347 annealed stainless steel fabricated to <br />a Westinghouse specification. Each bolt was installed within a counter-bore in the <br />baffle plate, recessed such that the top of the bolt head is flush with the baffle <br />plate surface. The bolts were torqued to impose a required pre-load, and a locking <br />tab was inserted into a milled slot in the bolt head and tack welded to the baffle <br />plate at the locking tab ends. The locking tabs ensure that the bolt does not back <br />out, and is also intended to capture loose parts that may be generated if a bolt <br />breaks. <br />CAUSE OF EVENT <br />The root cause of the baffle-former bolt failures is primarily Irradiation <br />Assisted Stress Corrosion Cracking (IASCC) and increased fatigue loading resulting <br />from loss of preload. Failure of a critical number of bolts in a localized area <br />subsequently imposed increased loading on adjacent bolts, thus increasing the <br />probability of failure of the adjacent bolts and generating the clustered pattern <br />seen in the inspection results. IASCC is a type, of stress corrosion cracking of <br />austenitic stainless steels and Nickel-based alloys that appears after irradiation <br />in aqueous (water) environments. IASCC is typically intergranular and the amount <br />of cracking increases with neutron exposure, until a saturation level is reached. <br />The -Failure Mode Analysis (FMA) has considered various factors and has determined <br />whether and to what extent they possibly could have impacted the failure <br />mechanism. Based on the FMA results, it has been concluded that IASCC was the <br />initiating degradation mechanism that resulted in flaws in the baffle-former <br />bolts. Failure analyses of selected removed bolts will be performed to confirm <br />this cause. <br />PAST SIMILAR EVENTS <br />None <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />S <br />Page 3 of 6 <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />1.

During replacement activities, 2 <br />additional bolts were determined to require replacement. <br />In total, replacement baffle-former bolts were installed in 278 locations. The <br />replacement bolt material is SA-479 Type 316 cold worked stainless steel with a <br />new type of anti-rotational/locking mechanism. These replacement baffle-former <br />bolts have been installed and utilized successfully at other operating plants <br />since 1998. The original bolts are 0.625 inch diameter. The size of the <br />replacement bolts is 0.625 inch diameter or 0.750 inch diameter, depending on <br />whether the bolt required machining of the thread major diameter to remove it. <br />• Failure analyses of selected removed bolts will be performed. <br />• Perform inspection of the baffle-former bolts in refueling outage 2R23. <br />• Implement a project in refueling outage 2R23 to convert reactor flow <br />configuration from downflow to upflow to improve margin for the baffle-former <br />assembly. <br />• Perform additional baffle-former bolt replacements to meet minimum bolting <br />pattern as evaluated by Westinghouse in 2R23. <br />EVENT ANALYSIS <br />The event was initially reportable under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B); the licensee <br />shall report any event or condition that results in the nuclear power plant being in <br />an unanalyzed condition that significantly degrades plant safety. As a press <br />release to communicate the condition to stakeholders was made, the event was also <br />reportable under 10 CFR 50.72(b)(2)(xi); the licensee shall report any event or <br />situation, related to the health and safety of the public or on-site personnel, or <br />protection of the environment, for which a news release is planned or notification <br />to other government agencies has been or will be made. The event notification was <br />made on March 29, 2016 (Event Number 51829). <br />The event is reportable under 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B); the licensee shall report any <br />event or condition that resulted in the nuclear power plant being in an unanalyzed <br />condition that significantly degrades plant safety. A minimum number of baffle-<br />former bolts are required for structural integrity and core cooling as determined in <br />an analysis of the baffle-former assembly in WCAP-18048-P. As determined by the <br />visual and UT inspections, this minimum number was exceeded. <br />Page 4 of 6 <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />1. FACILITY NAME 3. LER NUMBER 2.

These two criteria ensure the <br />safe shutdown of the" plant. The analysis methodology used for this safety <br />significance discussion is the same as that used in the acceptable baffle bolting <br />pattern analysis (ABPA), with additional considerations. <br />A preliminary review of the IP2 piping shows that it can meet the requirements for <br />expanded "Leak Before Break" (LBB) consideration for certain lines (10 and 14 inch <br />diameter) interfacing with the Reactor Coolant loops, which have been analyzed at <br />Westinghouse units similar in design to IP2. It is postulated that a flaw would <br />develop prior to complete pipe rupture (single or double-ended), leading to <br />leakage detectable by the existing RCS leakage detection systems and plant <br />shutdown before the flaw could grow to an unstable size. <br />The original baffle former dynamic analysis assumes that all of the baffle-to-<br />baffle edge bolts are no longer functional. Visual inspection of the baffle-to-<br />baffle edge bolts and the fuel was also performed during 2R22. These inspections <br />did not identify any damage to the edge bolts or evidence of baffle-gap jetting on <br />the fuel. Therefore, the baffle edge bolts do impart some strength and rigidity to <br />the baffle-former assembly and offset to an extent the failed baffle-former bolts. <br />The residual fractional strength for the failed baffle-former bolts was not <br />credited in the analyses. However, both in shear and in tension, many if not most <br />of the bolts with UT-identified indications retain some residual strength that <br />would act to limit baffle plate displacement and/or flexure. <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />00o%, <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />Page 5 of 6 <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />1.

No baffle-gap jetting has,been observed; therefore it is <br />reasonable to conclude that the edge bolts remain functional. The edge bolts are <br />the primary component for maintaining tight baffle gaps and the ABPA does not <br />consider the edge bolts when calculating bypass flow. Therefore, the bypass flow <br />condition can be considered to be bounded by the analyses in the ABPA. The momentum <br />flux is also controlled by the baffle gaps, and no leaking assemblies or baffle gap <br />jetting damage was noted on the fuel. <br />Based on the above considerations, it is reasonable to conclude that the analyses <br />which contribute to the safe shutdown of the plant demonstrate adequate margin. <br />Therefore, it is judged that the requirements for core coolability and safe <br />shutdown were met, considering LOCA and seismic loads concurrent with the observed <br />or declared 227 baffle-former bolt failures. Therefore, the safety significance of <br />thi's condition has been determined to be low. <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />Page 6 of 6 <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015)<br /></span>
