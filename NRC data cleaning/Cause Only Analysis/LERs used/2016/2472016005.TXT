ABSTRACT (Limit to 1400 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced type written lines) <br />On March 26, 2016, during a refueling outage, an NRC inspector identified that the trip <br />of the MBFPs is not tested in accordance with Technical Specification 3.7.3 <br />	 (Main <br />Feedwater System) Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.7.3.3. <br />	 This was discovered as a result <br />of an assessment of the failure of the Main Boiler Feedwater Pumps (MBFPs) steam stop <br />valves to close after the reactor trip on December 5, 2015. <br /> <br />• <br />TS SR 3.7.3.3 requires testing the MBFP trip function every 24 months on an actual or <br />simulated actuation signal. <br />	 Surveillance tests 2-PT-V024DS60 .and 2-PT-V24DS61 are <br />performed every 24 months, but only test up to the limit switch contact that actuates <br />the MBFP turbine.trip solenoid valves and does not include the trip of the pump.

This was discovered as a <br />result of an assessment of the failure of the Main Boiler Feedwater Pumps (MBFPs) steam <br />stop valves to close after the reactor trip on December 5, 2015. TS SR 3.7.3.3 <br />requires testing the MBFP trip function {JK} every 24 months on an actual or simulated <br />actuation signal. Surveillance tests 2-PT-V024DS60 and 2-PT-V24DS61 are performed <br />every 24 months, but only test up to the limit switch contact that actuates the MBFP <br />turbine trip solenoid valves and does not include the trip of the pump {P}. A review <br />determined the requirement to verify the trip of the MBFPs was added to the TS during <br />the implementation of the improved TS (ITS) conversion program but the corresponding <br />testing for MBFP trip was not added to the surveillance tests. The condition was <br />recorded in the Indian Point Energy Center (IPEC) Corrective Action Program (CAP) in <br />Condition Report CR-IP2-2016-02247. <br />The condition was revealed as a result of the plant trip on December 5, 2015, when the <br />MBFP did not trip remotely or locally, but required manual closure of steam admission <br />valves to trip it. The plant trip was recorded in CR-IP2-2015-05458 noting an <br />unexpected condition where the 21 MBFP HP and LP steam stop valves failed to close and <br />the 21 MBFP startup signal failed to lower from the control room. The cause of the <br />failure of the 21 MBFP to trip was contaminated control oil. <br />The MBFPs are steam driven pumps single stage, diffuser type, centrifugal pumps with a <br />capacity of approximately 15,300 gpm. Pumps are manufactured by Ingersoll-Rand, type 16 <br />JT. Both MBFPs are driven by a Westinghouse turbine {TRB}. During normal operation, <br />low pressure steam enters through the stop valve bolted to the end of the steam chest. <br />Steam flow is regulated by positioning of the governor valves within the steam chest. <br />MBFP turbine control system (J10 consists of an electronic governor, electronic hand <br />speed changer, hydraulically operated governor valve positioner and solenoid operated <br />stop valve controllers. The stop valve control oil pressure opens and closes the stop <br />valves by means of solenoid operated valves 29 and 31 {SOW. Stop valves are provided <br />in the main (high pressure) and reheat (low pressure) steam lines before the high and <br />low pressure governor valves. The stop valves are operated by servomotors which <br />receive control and operating oil from the high pressure oil system. High pressure <br />control oil to the servomotor positioning relay is controlled by the high and low <br />pressure stop valve solenoids. Each stop valve control solenoid when operated manually <br />or electrically by its control push button (open-close from the CR) will open or close <br />its respective valve. When the solenoids open, the high pressure control oil is dumped <br />and the stop valves close. <br />A historical review of the TS determined the custom TS (CTS) did not include a TS SR to <br />trip test the MBFPs. The inclusion of the TS SR to trip test the MBFPs occurred when <br />the CTS were converted to the Improved TS (ITS) based on NUREG-1431. The TS conversion <br />was conducted as a ITS Project by a contractor which included revising existing <br />procedures and preparing new procedures to address new ITS test requirements. In those <br />cases where the ITS requirements were new procedures they were prepared to address the <br />surveillance requirement. The project initially did not have specific department <br />representatives assigned to support the project and verify the SRs. The department <br />review process had no formal project guidelines or procedures. It is indeterminate why <br />the test of the MBFP was missed during the review/implementation process. <br />NRC FORM 366AU.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(01-2014) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />FACILITY NAME (1) DOCKET (2) LER NUMBER (6) PAGE (3) <br />YEAR <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER  <br />REVISION <br />NUMBER <br />Indian Point Unit 2  05000-247  2016 	 005 	 00  3 OF 4 <br />An extent of condition (EOC) review determined that the Unit 3 TS 3.7.3 does not have a <br />surveillance requirement to trip test the MBFPs. The EOC review identified an adverse <br />trend CR in 2004 during the ITS conversion. As a result of the adverse trend CR an <br />action plan was implemented that included an action to review the ITS surveillance <br />testing requirements and basis against test procedures for compliance in meeting the ITS <br />SR. Several changes were identified and corrections implemented. <br />Cause of Event <br />The direct cause of not testing that the MBFP tripped on an actuation signal was human <br />error for failure to ensure testing Was established to meet new ITS SRs. The apparent <br />cause of the error is indeterminate due to the time passed since TS conversion by <br />Amendment 238 on November 21, 2003. A review determined the requirement to verify the <br />trip of the MBFPs was added to the TS during the implementation of the improved TS (ITS) <br />conversion program but the complete testing to include a MBFP trip was not added to the <br />surveillance tests. <br />Corrective Actions <br />The following corrective actions have been or will be performed under Entergy's <br />Corrective Action Program to address the cause and prevent recurrence: <br />• Surveillance test procedures 2-PT-V024 DS060 and 2-PT-V024 DS061 were revised to <br />trip the MBFPs to satisfy the test surveillance requirement SR 3.7.3.3 of TS 3.7.3. <br />• Testing of the MBFP actuation function to include pump trip will be performed prior <br />to startup from the outage. <br />Event Analysis <br />The event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). The licensee shall report <br />any operation or condition which was prohibited by the plant's TS. This condition <br />meets the reporting criteria because TS 3.7.3 (Main Feedwater System) requires the <br />two MBFP discharge valves and the trip function to be operable. TS 3.7.3 Condition D <br />(One or both MBFP trips inoperable) required action D.1 is to restore MBFP trip to <br />operable or trip the associated MBFP within 72 hours. Condition F (Required action <br />and associated completion time not met) required action F.1 is to be in mode 3 in 6 <br />hours and F.2 be in mode 4 in 12 hours. The trip function of the MBFP was deemed <br />inoperable because it was determined the TS SR 3.7.3.3 surveillance procedures did <br />not trip the MBFPs to demonstrate operability. Initially the condition appeared to <br />be a missed surveillance. However, review of regulatory action on this issue <br />determined that the condition would not be considered a failure to perform a <br />surveillance within the specified frequency in accordance with SR applicability 3.0.1 <br />which would be a failure to meet the LCO except as provided in SR 3.0.3. Because <br />there was no surveillance to test the trip of the MBFPs, the condition meets the NRC <br />guidance and is being treated as a TS prohibited condition. <br />There was no safety system functional failure reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v). <br />Isolation of the main FW would have been accomplished by closure of the Main FW <br />Regulating Valves (MFRVs), and the closure of all four Low Flow Main FW Bypass Valves <br />(FBVs). In accordance with TS Basis 3.7.3, if all four Main Feedwater Regulating <br />Valves (MFRVs) and all four Low Flow Main Feedwater Bypass Valves (FBVs) close within <br />the time limits that satisfy accident analysis assumptions, main FW isolation to all <br />four steam geherators (SGs) is satisfied. Closure of both MBFP discharge valves which <br />initiates closure of all- eight MFRVs and trip of both MBFPs is a redundancy feature. <br />In accordance with reporting guidance in NUREG-1022, an additional random single <br />failure need not be assumed in that system during the condition. <br />NRC FORM 366AU.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(01-2014) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />LER NUMBER (6) 	 • DOCKET (2) FACILITY NAME (1) PAGE (3) <br />YEAR <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER  <br />REVISION <br />NUMBER <br />Indian Point Unit 2  05000-247  2016 	 005 . 	 00  4 OF 4 <br />NARRATIVE (If more space is required, use additional copies of NRC Form 366A) (17) <br />Past Similar Events <br />A review was performed of the past three years of Licensee Event Reports (LERs) for <br />events reporting a TS violation due to inoperable MBFPs trip function. No LERs were <br />identified. <br />Safety Significance <br />This event had no effect on the health and safety of the public. There were no actual <br />safety con-sequences for the event because there were no accidents or events during the <br />degraded condition. <br />Isolation of the main FW system is necessary to mitigate accident and transient <br />conditions [Main Steam Line Breaks (SLB), SG Tube Ruptures, and Excessive Heat Removal <br />Due to FW System Malfunction]. Main FW must be isolated to prevent excessive reactor <br />coolant system cooldown, containment overpressure, and steam line overfill. Main FW <br />isolation is initiated by either an Engineered Safety Feature Actuation System (ESFAS) <br />safety injection (SI) signal or a high steam generator water level signal. Main FW <br />isolation to all four SGs is provided by either 1) Closure of all four main FW <br />regulating valves (MFRVs) and all four Low Flow Main FW Bypass Valves (FBVs), or 2) <br />Closure of both MBFP discharge valves which initiates closure of all eight FW Isolation <br />Valves (MFIVs), and the trip of both MBFPs. Either of these combinations is capable of <br />achieving main FW isolation to all four SGs within the time limits assumed in the <br />accident analysis. If all eight valves referenced in item 1 close, main FW isolation <br />to all four SGs is completed within time limits that satisfy accident analysis <br />assumptions. To establish redundancy for main FW isolation safety function, the SI <br />ESFAS or High SG Level signal also provides a direct signal that closes the two MBFP <br />discharge valves. When both MBFP discharge valves move off the open seat, the relay <br />actuates and generates a signal that initiates closure of the four main FW isolation <br />valves (MFIVs) and the four Low Flow FIVs. For this event, one of the FW isolation <br />capabilities was operable as the post transient report for the reactor trip on December <br />5,. 2015, recorded FW isolated. This event was bounded by the analyzed event described <br />in FSAR Section 14.1.10, (Excessive Heat Removal Due to Feedwater System Malfunctions). <br />Excessive FW additions is an analyzed event postulated to occur from a malfunction of <br />the FW control system or an operator error which results in the opening of a FW control <br />valve. The analysis assumes one FW valve opens fully resulting in the excessive FW <br />flow to one SG. For the FW system malfunction at full power, the FW flow resulting <br />from a fully open control valve is terminated by the SG high level signal that closes <br />all FW control valves and trips the MBFPs. The SG high water level signal also <br />produces a signal to trip the main turbine which initiates a reactor trip. The <br />analysis for all cases of the excessive FW addition initiated\at full power conditions <br />with and without automatic rod control, show that the minimum DNBR remains above the <br />applicable safety analysis DNBR limit. In the case of excessive FW flow with the <br />reactor at zero power, the resulting transient is similar to, but less severe than the <br />hypothetical steamline break transient and is bounded by the analysis in UFSAR Section <br />14.2.5 (Rupture, of a Steam Pipe).<br /></span>
