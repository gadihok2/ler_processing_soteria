Operations declared <br />HV-AOV-265 inoperable and entered Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.6.4.2, Condition A, and commenced <br />preparations to transition the plant to single loop operation, including reducing the plant to approximately 50 percent <br />power. Upon investigation, it was discovered that the air supply line to the valve was pinched between the valve <br />actuator and a scaffold that was erected to support work on a nearby component. After modifying the scaffold and <br />replacing the pinched airline, the valve was tested satisfactorily and Operations exited the LCO and activities to <br />prepare for transition to single loop operation were terminated. <br />The root cause of the event is that personnel involved in the planning, construction, and inspection of the scaffold built <br />for a nearby component were not aware of the unique external movement path of the valve actuator. To prevent <br />recurrence, the procedure will be revised to include specific guidance for the planning, building and inspection of <br />scaffolds in the vicinity of HV-AOV-265 and other AOVs having actuators of similar design. Signage has been <br />installed to warn personnel of the external movement of these AOVs. <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016) <br />Page 2 of 4 <br />NRC FORM 366 <br />	<br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />(See Page 2 for required number of digits/characters for each <br />block) <br />(See NUREG-1022, R 3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.govireading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr10221r31)  <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 <br />	 EXPIRES: 10131/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 <br />hours.

LER NUMBER 2. DOCKET NUMBER <br />05000- 298 <br />1. FACILITY NAME <br />Cooper Nuclear Station <br />NARRATIVE <br />PLANT STATUS <br />Cooper Nuclear Station was in Mode 1, Power Operation, at 89 percent power, approaching the end of <br />Cycle 29 in two-loop operation, at the time the condition was identified. <br />BACKGROUND <br />The safety objective of the Secondary Containment system [EIIS:NG] in conjunction with other... <br />engineering safeguards and nuclear safety systems is to limit the release to the environs of radioactive <br />material so that off-site doses from a postulated design basis accident will be below the values <br />permitted. <br />The reactor building isolation and control system serves to trip the reactor building [EIIS:NG] supply and <br />exhaust fans [El IS:FAN], isolate the normal ventilation system and provide the starting signals for the <br />Standby Gas Treatment (SGT) [El IS:BH] system in the event of a postulated Loss of Coolant Accident <br />inside the drywell [EIIS:NG] or the postulated fuel handling accident in the reactor building. <br />Two normally open dampers [EIIS:DMP], in series, are provided both in the supply path and two exhaust <br />paths for the reactor building and the two supply and exhaust paths for Reactor Recirculation Motor <br />Generator (RRMG) set ventilation. Each set of dampers consists of one air actuated damper, supplied <br />by instrument air backed up by an accumulator [EIIS:ACC] with an assured one-hour supply capacity, <br />and a motor operated damper. These dampers ensure redundant, diverse isolation capability for the <br />reactor building in the event of a release of radioactive material to the reactor building. These dampers <br />close automatically on a Group 6 (Secondary Containment Isolation) isolation signal. <br />HV-AOV-265 is the RRMG Ventilation Supply Outboard Isolation Valve for RRMG 1B. This air operated <br />valve (AOV) is normally open during plant operation. In addition to driving the actuator shaft, the air <br />actuator cylinder physically rotates when the valve is opened or closed. This results in a large actuator <br />movement path that includes the actuator shaft, cylinder, valve disc arm, and the airlines that connect to <br />the cylinder. <br />EVENT DESCRIPTION <br />On September 14, 2016, during testing of the Reactor Recirculation Motor Generator Ventilation Air <br />Operated Isolation Valves, the control switch for HV-AOV-265 was taken to close for valve stroke timing. <br />The valve failed to close. HV-AOV-265 was declared inoperable and Technical Specification (TS) <br />Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.6.4.2, Condition A, Required Action A.1, "Isolate the affected <br />penetration flow path by use of at least one closed and de-activated valve within 8 hours," was entered. <br />In addition, Operations commenced preparations for transitioning the plant to single loop operation, <br />including reducing power to approximately 50 percent to support removing the associated RRMG set <br />from service. <br />Operations attempted to close HV-AOV-265 while an Engineer was stationed locally to observe the valve's <br />operation. The Engineer identified that during the attempt to close the valve, the air supply line became <br />pinched between the moving cylinder of the valve actuator and a scaffold that had been erected on June <br />29, 2016, to support work on a different valve. <br />YEAR <br />2016 <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />- 003 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />- 00 <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016) <br />Page 3 of 4 <br />NRC FORM 366 <br />	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />(See Page 2 for required number of digits/characters for each <br />block) <br />(See NUREG-1022, R 3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1022/r3/)  <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 <br />hours.

LER NUMBER <br />YEAR <br />2016 <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />- 003 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />- 00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />As such, air was restricted from exhausting from the air cylinder, pneumatically locking the piston and <br />preventing the valve from closing. Further investigation revealed that the airline had been crimped and <br />required replacement. <br />After modifying the scaffold to remove the interference with the operation of the valve, the airline for HV-<br />AO-265 was replaced and the valve stroke testing was re-performed satisfactorily. HV-AO-265 was <br />declared operable and TS LCO 3.6.4.2 was exited. Upon exiting the LCO, activities to prepare for <br />transition to single loop operation were terminated. <br />BASIS FOR REPORT <br />This condition is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as a condition prohibited by TS <br />because the scaffolding, installed in June 2016, was in a position to block the movement of the valve <br />since that time. <br />SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE <br />The safety significance of this event is low. Secondary Containment AOV, HV-AO-265, could not be fully <br />closed; however, the redundant motor operated valve in the RRMG B ventilation inlet flow path; HV-MO-<br />264, provided the required safety function for Secondary Containment isolation. This event did not <br />cause an impact to the safety of the general public, nuclear safety, industrial safety, or radiological <br />safety. <br />CAUSE <br />The root cause of the event was determined to be that the personnel involved in the planning, <br />construction, and inspection of the scaffold built for HV-MOV-264 were not aware of the external <br />movement path of HV-AOV-265 actuator. <br />CORRECTIVE ACTIONS <br />Revise Maintenance Procedure 7.0.7, "Scaffolding Construction and Control," to include specific <br />guidance for the planning, building and inspection of scaffolds in the vicinity of the AOVs listed below: <br />1.
