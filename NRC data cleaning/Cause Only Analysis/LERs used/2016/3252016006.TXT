EXPECTED <br />SUBMISSION <br />DATE <br />MONTH DAY YEAR <br />ABSTRACT (Limit to 1400 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) <br />On December 13, 2016, Units 1 and 2 were in Mode 1 (i.e., Run mode) at 98 percent and 97 percent of <br />rated thermal power, respectively. At that time, shift personnel were notified that structural supports for the <br />2D Control Room air conditioning system condenser were corroded. An operability assessment found the <br />affected air conditioning system inoperable due to the effect on its seismic qualification. Technical <br />Specifications (TS) 3.7.4, Condition A, was entered. On January 30, 2017, the 1D air conditioning system <br />was found with similar conditions. The duration of the condition and the fact that more than one air <br />conditioning system was inoperable simultaneously resulted in the plant operating in a condition prohibited <br />by the TS and in a loss of the safety function. This event resulted from a lack, in some cases, of station <br />personnel being cognizant of risks related to resolving complex, long-standing issues that continue to <br />degrade over time. All affected support steel was replaced by February 2, 2017. The remaining air <br />conditioner was inspected and found acceptable. Administrative actions will be taken to identify high <br />consequence plant issues and periodically reassess priorities. <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016) <br />1. FACILITY NAME <br />NARRATIVE <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(06-2016) <br />Brunswick Steam Electric Plant (BSEP) <br />Unit 1 <br />On December 13, 2016, a periodic inspection was being performed on the Control Building [NA] air <br />conditioner compressors and condensing coils of air conditioner 2D. During the inspection, seismically <br />qualified support members were found to be degraded due to corrosion. This condition was reported to <br />shift personnel in the Main Control Room, and further assessment was initiated. On December 14, 2016, it <br />was determined that the air conditioning unit supported by the corroded members could not be reasonably <br />assured of meeting its seismic qualifications. Therefore, air conditioner 2D was declared inoperable and <br />TS 3.7.4, Condition A was entered. The affected support members for air conditioning unit 2D were <br />replaced under Work Order 20132955 on December 22, 2016, and the TS condition was exited. <br />On December 13, 2016, at 16:27 Eastern Standard Time (EST), Unit 1 was in Mode 1 at approximately <br />98 percent of rated thermal power. Unit 2 was in Mode 1 at approximately 97 percent of rated thermal <br />power. Other than the components specifically named in this report, no out-of-service equipment <br />contributed to, or affected the course of, this event. <br />This event is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) because Units 1 and 2 were <br />operated in a condition which is prohibited by the Technical Specifications (TS). Specifically, air <br />conditioning units 1D and 2D for the Main Control Room [NA] were inoperable on account of seismically-<br />qualified structural supports being degraded due to corrosion. The duration of the inoperability could not <br />be conclusively determined. Therefore, the air conditioners are conservatively concluded to have been <br />inoperable for longer than the 30 days allowed by TS 3.7.4, Condition A (i.e., one Control Room Air <br />Conditioning subsystem inoperable) and the 72 hours allowed by TS 3.7.4, Condition B (i.e., two Control <br />Room Air Conditioning subsystems inoperable). Since these times were exceeded, the plant was in a <br />condition prohibited by the TS. The condition applies to both units because the air conditioning system <br />serves the shared Control Room. <br />The event is also reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) as an event or condition that could have <br />prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to mitigate the <br />consequences of an accident. With two air conditioning units inoperable, the safety function of maintaining <br />Control Room habitability could not be assured. The condition applies to both units because the air <br />conditioning system serves the shared Control Room. <br />Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX]. <br />Background <br />Initial Conditions <br />Reportability Criteria <br />Event Description <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1022/r3/)  <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />05000-325 <br />2.

FACILITY NAME <br />NARRATIVE <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(06-2016) <br />Brunswick Steam Electric Plant (BSEP) <br />Unit 1 <br />Three 50 percent capacity Control Room air conditioning units provide temperature and humidity control for <br />the Control Room during normal and accident conditions. Two units are normally required to maintain the <br />designed environmental conditions. <br />Since the air conditioning system is required to be seismically qualified, it was declared inoperable until the <br />corroded support members were replaced or repaired. However, during this event, the affected air <br />conditioning system remained capable of performing its function under all but seismic conditions. Per <br />normal operating practices, at least two air conditioning units were always operating, including those times <br />when safety function could not be credited due to compromised seismic qualifications. <br />Additionally, on January 30, 2017, an inspection, as part of the extent of condition, determined that <br />significant corrosion existed on support members for the 1D air conditioner. Therefore, the 1D air <br />conditioner was declared inoperable, and TS 3.7.4, Condition A was entered. <br />On both air conditioners, the duration of the corroded condition could not be established with certainty. The <br />periodic maintenance activity which resulted in identifying the corrosion is performed approximately every <br />six months. The last inspection for the 2D air conditioner took place on May 18, 2016, and was completed <br />satisfactorily at that time. The last inspection for the 1D air conditioner took place on December 1, 2016, <br />and was completed satisfactorily at that time. Since corrosion is typically a slow-acting phenomenon, it is <br />concluded that the affected structural members had degraded to the point of becoming inoperable more <br />than 30 days before discovery (i.e., for longer than the TS allowable out-of-service time). Therefore, the 1D <br />air conditioner should have been recognized as inoperable on December 1, 2016, but was not. <br />Review of plant history revealed that the only remaining Control Room air conditioning unit, the 2E, had <br />been removed from service during the period when the 2D and 1D are believed to have been inoperable <br />due to compromised seismic qualifications. This occurred on October 18, 2016, from 04:42 EST until <br />11:54 EST for a total of 7 hours, 12 minutes. During this time, only the two seismically unqualified air <br />conditioning unit units remained in operation. <br />The corrosion of steel supports for the two air conditioning units resulted from exposure to a marine <br />environment coupled with trapped moisture. This degraded the protective phenolic coating and then the <br />underlying metal. <br />The apparent cause of the event was determined to be that, in some cases, the station is not cognizant of <br />risks related to resolving complex, long-standing issues that continue to degrade with time. <br />Safety Assessment <br />Event Causes <br />Based on this analysis, this event had no adverse impact on the health and safety of the public. <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1022/r3/)  <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />05000-325 <br />2.

Site <br />procedure AD-WC-ALL-210, “Work Request Initiation, Screening, Prioritization and Classification,” already <br />requires a WR to be written for plant material deficiencies. The revision to the model work order will <br />strengthen that existing guidance. This action is scheduled to be completed by May 1, 2017. <br />No events have occurred in the past three years in which a plant structure, system, or component was <br />found to be inoperable due to general environmental corrosion or similar degradation mechanisms. <br />The affected support members for air conditioning unit 2D were replaced under Work Order 20132955 on <br />December 22, 2016. This action is complete. <br />The affected support members for air conditioning unit 1D were replaced under Work Order 20139332 on <br />February 2, 2017.
