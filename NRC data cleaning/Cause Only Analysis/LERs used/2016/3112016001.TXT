In November 2015, the isolation valve for the pressure override defeat pressure <br />transmitter was found closed. The pressure transmitter provides an input into the 21 AFW Pump <br />run-out protection circuit. With the isolation valve closed, it would take longer to sense pump <br />discharge head and consequently the opening of the auxiliary feed pump flow control valves <br />would be slower than normal. This condition resulted in 21 Auxiliary Feedwater Pump loop time <br />response greater than Technical Specification (TS) acceptance criteria. The failed channel was <br />not recognized and the TS action was not taken, resulting in a condition prohibited by TS. The <br />investigation revealed that the condition most likely existed since April 20, 2015, when <br />maintenance activities were performed on the auxiliary feedwater pump discharge pressure <br />transmitter. The isolation valve was opened and the surveillance was performed satisfactorily. <br />This report is being made in accordance with 10CFR50.73 (a)(2)(i)(B), "Any operation or condition <br />which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications." <br />NRC FORM 366 (02-2014) <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 US.

In November 2015, the <br />isolation valve for the pressure override defeat pressure transmitter was found closed. The pressure <br />transmitter provides an input into the 21 AFW Pump run-out protection circuit. With the isolation valve <br />closed, it would take longer to sense pump discharge head and consequently the opening of the auxiliary <br />feed pump flow control valves {BA/FCV} would be slower than normal. The AFW flow control valves will <br />not open until adequate pump discharge head is sensed by the pressure transmitter. This condition <br />resulted in 21 Auxiliary Feedwater Pump loop time response greater than Technical Specification (TS) <br />acceptance criteria. The failed channel was not recognized and the TS action was not taken, resulting in a <br />condition prohibited by TS. The investigation revealed that the condition most likely existed since <br />April 20, 2015, when maintenance activities were performed on the auxiliary feedwater pump discharge <br />pressure transmitter. This condition resulted in 21 Auxiliary Feedwater Pump loop time response greater <br />than the acceptance criteria required by surveillance 4.3.2.1.3.

PAGE  <br />3 OF 4 <br />REVISION <br />NUMBER <br />Operations began time response testing in advance of the scheduled refueling outage while still in <br />MODE 1. When 21 AFW loop was tested, the long response time of the flow control valves for the <br />two loops associated with the pump were noticed, but not documented or investigated for impact on <br />operability. <br />When I&C began to collate time response data from the outage testing, they recognized the failure <br />to meet the acceptance criteria for 21 AFW loop time response. The isolation valve for the <br />discharge pressure transmitter was found closed. The isolation valve was opened, and the loop <br />response time testing was completed with satisfactory results. <br />The investigation for the mispositioned pressure transmitter isolation valve did not definitively <br />conclude that the maintenance activities of April 20, 2015, created the condition, but no other <br />procedures operate the isolation valve. All other AFW surveillances were completed satisfactorily <br />during the period from April through October. The dynamic system response and the pressure <br />override function are only tested by the time response surveillance ; the other AFW surveillances <br />would not reveal the mispositioned pressure transmitter isolation valve. <br />The impact of the mispositioned valve was not recognized until a review of outage data was <br />performed on January 19, 2016. <br />This event is being recorded in accordance with 10CFR50.73 (a)(2)(i)(B), "Any operation or <br />condition which was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications." <br />CAUSE OF EVENT <br />The most likely cause of this event was the failure to return the auxiliary feedwater pump discharge pressure <br />transmitter instrument isolation valve to the open position following transmitter calibration. <br />SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS <br />The Auxiliary Feedwater (AFW) System serves as a backup system for supplying feedwater to the secondary <br />side of the steam generators at times when the Main Feedwater System is not available. The AFW System is <br />relied upon to prevent core damage and system overpressurization. <br />An engineering review concluded that while the AFW loop response time test results did not meet the <br />procedural acceptance criteria, the accident analysis assumptions remained valid. The ATWS (Anticipated <br />Transient Without Scram) was determined to be the limiting accident, and the loop response times were still <br />bounded by the existing analyses. There were no safety consequences as a result of this event <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 01/31/2017 <br />02-2014) Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request 80 <br />hours.
