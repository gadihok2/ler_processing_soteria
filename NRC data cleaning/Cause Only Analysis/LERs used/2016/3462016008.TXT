At 2342 hours a power supply in SFAS Channel 2 failed and a separate TS LCO 3.3.5 Condition A was <br />entered. Upon recognition that two channels of SFAS were inoperable, TS LCO 3.3.5 Condition B was entered at 0245 <br />and then exited at 0330 with the use of compensatory actions to restore SFAS Channel 1 operability. After further <br />review, it was determined the compensatory actions could not be credited and TS LCO 3.3.5, Condition B was re-<br />entered at 1325. SFAS Channel 1 was restored and declared operable at 1351 hours. <br />Causes of the event were the Shift Manager failed to initially recognize that TS LCO Conditions A and B had been met; <br />followed by Station Personnel failing to effectively implement required processes. The root cause was that Station <br />Management failed to recognize that a normalized deviation had occurred that resulted in TS noncompliance. Corrective <br />Actions include specific refresher training to all applicable personnel, revising relevant documents, and developing an <br />event Case Study for training purposes. This condition is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as <br />an operation or condition prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications. <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016) <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(11-2015) <br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.00vireadinci-rm/doc-collections/nurecis/staff/sr1022/r31  <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

LER NUMBER <br />Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station Unit 1 <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />- 008 <br />05000 - 	 346 YEAR <br />2016 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />- 01 <br />NARRATIVE <br />Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX]. <br />DESCRIPTION OF OCCURRENCE: <br />System Description: <br />The Safety Features Actuation System (SFAS) [JE] at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station (DBNPS) is <br />designed to automatically prevent or limit fission product and energy release from the core, to isolate the <br />containment vessel and to initiate the operation of Engineered Safety Features equipment in the event of a <br />loss of coolant accident and main steam line break. The SFAS operates in a distributed manner to initiate the <br />appropriate systems. The SFAS does this by determining the need for actuation in each of four channels <br />monitoring each actuation parameter. Once the need for actuation is determined, the condition is transmitted <br />to automatic actuation logics, which perform the two-out-of-four logic to determine the actuation of each end <br />device. Four plant parameters are used for automatic SFAS actuation. The fifth parameter, the Borated <br />Water Storage Tank (BWST) [BP-T] Level — Low Low, is used to provide a permissive to allow manual <br />transfer from the BWST to the containment emergency sump. <br />The SFAS consists of four identical redundant instrument (sensing) and logic channels and two identical <br />redundant actuation channels, and each instrument channel includes trip bistable modules with digital <br />isolation devices. The isolated output of the trip bistable module is used to comprise coincidence matrices <br />with the terminating relays within the actuation channel of the SFAS. The trip bistables monitor the station <br />variables and normally feed continuous electrical (fail-safe) signals into two-out-of-four coincidence matrices. <br />Should any of the station variables exceed their trip setpoints, the corresponding bistables in each of the four <br />channels will trip and cease sending output signals. If two of the four channel bistables monitoring the same <br />station variable cease to send output signals, the corresponding normally-energized terminating relays on all <br />channels will trip. <br />The SFAS is a fail-safe, de-energize to trip, system. Therefore, if the power supply to a channel is lost, that <br />channel will trip, reducing the system coincidence matrices from two-out-of-four to one-out-of-three mode. <br />The terminating relays of sensing and logic channels 1 and 3 must both be de-energized to activate safety <br />actuation channel 1. Similarly, sensing and logic channels 2 and 4 must both be de-energized to activate <br />safety actuation channel 2. The terminating relays (also known as output relays) [JE-RLY] act on the <br />actuation control devices such as motor controllers and solenoid valves. <br />The BWST supplies borated water for emergency core cooling via the Decay Heat Removal/Low Pressure <br />Injection (LPI) System [BP] and High Pressure Injection (HPI) System [BJ], and as a source of borated water <br />for the Containment Spray System [BE]. During accident conditions, the BWST provides containment cooling <br />and depressurization, core cooling, and replacement inventory and is a source of negative reactivity for <br />reactor shutdown. The BWST ensures that an adequate supply of borated water is available to cool and <br />depressurize the containment in the event of a Design Bases Accident (DBA); to cool and cover the core in <br />the event of a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA.), and to ensure an adequate level exists in the containment <br />sump to support ECCS and containment spray pump operation in the recirculation mode. <br />The BWST level is monitored by four independent level transmitters. Each of the differential pressure signals <br />generated by these transmitters is monitored by a bistable to provide a trip signal at a low low level.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LER NUMBER <br />Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station Unit 1 <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />008 <br />05000 - 	 346 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />- 01 <br />NARRATIVE <br />DESCRIPTION OF OCCURRENCE: (continued) <br />inches of water was chosen to provide the operator with an alarm and a permissive to allow timely operation <br />of the BWST outlet and containment emergency sump valves to the long term recirculation position. This is <br />to protect the pumps from cavitation for lack of proper net positive suction head and allow transfer of ECCS <br />suction to the containment emergency sump from the BWST during the recirculation mode of operation <br />before the inventory of the BWST is depleted. <br />Technical Specification(s): <br />Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.3.5 requireS four channels of SFAS <br />instrumentation for each parameter to be operable in each SFAS train. Failure of any instrument renders the <br />affected channel(s) inoperable and reduces the reliability of the affected parameter and affected systems or <br />components. With one or more parameters with one channel inoperable, Condition A requires one channel <br />be placed in trip in one hour. With one channel placed in trip in an hour and Condition A not met, or one or <br />more parameters with two or more channels rendered inoperable, Condition B requires the unit to be in Mode <br />3 in 6 hours and Mode 5 within 36 hours. <br />DESCRIPTION OF EVENT: <br />On June 30, 2016, at 0829, with the DBNPS operating in Mode 1 at approximately 100 percent power, BWST <br />SFAS Channel 1 Level Transmitter LT1525A was taken out of service for maintenance to replace the <br />enclosure box and for calibration activities. SFAS Channel 1 was declared inoperable and TS LCO 3.3.5, <br />Condition A was entered and the associated bistable for BWST Level was tripped. At 2342 hours with <br />LT1525A still out of service, a failure of SFAS Channel 2 +15 Volt Power Supply occurred, rendering the <br />SFAS Channel 2 inoperable, including SFAS Channel 2 BWST level instrument LT1525B. BWST Level <br />Transmitters for SFAS Channel 3 (LT1525C) and SFAS Channel 4 (LT1525D) remained operable. A <br />separate entry into TS LCO 3.3.5 Condition A was made at 2342 hours, but no entry into TS LCO 3.3.5 <br />Condition B was made. At approximately 0140 hours on July 1, 2016, the Operations Crew became aware <br />that TS LCO 3.3.5 Condition B should have been entered and various members of the Duty Team <br />organization were contacted to discuss applicability of TS LCO 3.3.5 Conditions A and B. <br />On July 1, 2016, at 0245 hours following a plant Duty Team discussion where the condition was re-assessed, <br />the proper additional TS LCO 3.3.5, Condition B was entered as required for two channels of BWST level <br />functions inoperable, which requires a plant shutdown to Mode 3 in 6 hours. Following further discussions, <br />between Operations and select Duty Team personnel, it was believed that SFAS Channel 1 could be <br />considered operable with compensatory actions due to the BWST Level - Low Low level being a transfer <br />permissive that allows transfer to the Emergency Sump with 'less than nine feet of level in the BWST. The <br />compensatory actions were specific to SFAS Channel 1. Therefore, Operations exited TS LCO 3.3.5 <br />Condition B at 0330 hours. <br />After further review, it was determined the compensatory actions associated with BWST Level - Low Low <br />level transmitter could not be credited and the previous operability determination for SFAS Channel 1 was <br />invalid. Operations re-entered TS LCO 3.3.5, Conditions A and B at 1325 hours. <br />YEAR <br />2016 <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 3 of 7 <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(11-2015) <br />0°4'444 <br />fit: () <br />111111i <br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.ciovireadinci-rm/doc-collections/nureqs/staff/sr1022/r3/ <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

Upon <br />replacement and testing of the +15 Volt power supply, SFAS Channel 2 was declared operable and TS LCO <br />3.3.5 Condition A was exited at 1800 hours on July 1, 2016. <br />CAUSE OF EVENT <br />The direct cause for the failure to properly apply TS 3.3.5 was determined to be that the Shift Manager failed <br />to initially recognize that entry conditions for TS LCO 3.3.5 Condition B had been met following a loss of <br />power to SFAS Channel 2. The TS was not reviewed in its entirety and provided peer checks were not <br />performed independently. <br />A contributing cause of the improper application of TS 3.3.5 was determined to be that station personnel <br />failed to use or rigorously implement required processes and procedures involving the conduct of operations, <br />event reporting, operability determination, and regulatory communications and interface. <br />The root cause for the failure to properly apply TS 3.3.5 was determined to be that station management failed <br />to recognize in a timely manner that a normalized deviation in organizational behaviors has occurred <br />surrounding the accountability for.critical performance standards and expectations. Additionally, <br />organizational biases such as maintaining an unrealistic optimism towards an outcome, technical arrogance, <br />overconfidence in knowledge and expertise, and the failure to seek or respond effectively to challenges, have <br />resulted in the tendency to rationalize behaviors. <br />ANALYSIS OF EVENT <br />The BWST Level Transmitters monitor the BWST Level and initiate an SFAS Level 5 signal on BWST Level -<br />Low Low. This output signal provides a passive permissive interlock to allow operators the ability to shift <br />ECCS suction from the BWST to the Emergency Sump by allowing operators to Open the Decay Heat Pump <br />Suction From Emergency Sump Valves and close the associated BWST Isolation Valves. The transfer of <br />suction source from the BWST to the Emergency Sump is a manual transfer. The Probabilistic Risk Analysis <br />(PRA) models failure of the SFAS. Level 5 permissive signal, as well as failure of the valves to be repositioned <br />(or failure of the human action to manually transfer the suction), which could result in the inability of the plant <br />to shift ECCS suction from the BWST to the Emergency Sump. <br />The four-channel SFAS system is a 2-out-of-four circuit, such that any two level instruments which sense a <br />BWST Level — Low Low will actuate the permissive interlock for both trains. With both LT1525A and <br />LT1525B out of service, the SFAS BWST Level — Low Low passive permissive transfer was active (i.e., the <br />valves could be repositioned to shift from the BWST to the Emergency Sump) as indicated by Annunciator 5-<br />3-A, BWST LO-LO LVL XFER TO EMER SUMP. Since the permissive interlock was met, a failure of this <br />SFAS Level 5 permissive signal is not possible. <br />Having the transfer permissive interlock active while the BWST was still full could permit operators to <br />inadvertently transfer suction from the BWST to the Emergency Sump (violating procedure guidance) before <br />there was adequate volume in the Emergency Sump. Additionally, having the transfer permissive <br />annunciator 5-3-A lit significantly prior to reaching the BWST Level procedurally directing the transfer to the <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 4 of 7 <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nureos/staff/srl 022/r3/ <br />f<br />. <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

However, by procedure and by training, Operators <br />would monitor, log, and trend BWST level, so they would be aware when the proper time to transfer occurred, <br />and there would be minimal increase in the failure to perform the required action. <br />Based on the above, the condition of having two BWST Level Transmitters out of service does not result in an <br />increase in CDF, as calculated by the PRA model, and this condition would be considered to have a very low <br />safety significance. <br />Reportability Discussion: <br />On June 30, 2016, at 2342 hours, with the failure of SFAS Channel 2 Power supply, and SFAS Channel 1 <br />BWST Level Transmitter previously declared inoperable for maintenance, TS 3.3.5, Condition B should have <br />been entered due to the BWST parameter being inoperable for two channels of SFAS, requiring a 6-hour <br />shutdown of the unit. However, as described above, while Condition B was entered on July 1, 2016 at 0245 <br />hours, it was inappropriately exited at 0330 hours, and no shutdown initiated. Because the unit continued to <br />operate after July 1, 2016, at 0542 hours with two channels of SFAS inoperable, this represents continued <br />operation or condition prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications, which is reportable per 10 CFR <br />50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). On July 10, 2016, a retrospective notification was made to the NRC (Event Number 52079) <br />for initiation of a plant shutdown as required by the TS that should have been made in accordance with 10 <br />CFR 50.72(b)(2)(i). All safety systems performed as required in response to the event, and no loss of safety <br />function occurred. <br />CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: <br />Immediate and Completed Actions: <br />Upon completion of maintenance and successful testing, SFAS Channel 1 BWST Level Transmitter <br />(LT1525A) was declared operable at 1351 hours on July 1, 2016. Upon replacement and testing of the +15 <br />Volt power supply, SFAS Channel 2 was declared operable at 1800 hours on July 1, 2016. <br />The individual human performance issues by station personnel determined to have been in responsible <br />decision making roles during the events were addressed in accordance with the company performance <br />management process. <br />Station Leadership sought support of independent observers from the First Energy Nuclear Operating <br />Company (FENOC) fleet to monitor activities in the control room during plant start-up from the most recent <br />forced outage. An intended focus was to observe TS implementation. <br />Site Leadership conducted an All-Hands session with station personnel emphasizing the series of significant <br />events in 2016 which resulted from gaps in performance standards. The Site Vice-President communicated <br />that culpability for the deficiencies was shared among all station organizations. As such, it was emphasized <br />that all personnel must internalize the need to modify behaviors to achieve event free operation. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 5 of 7 <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(11-2015) <br />d.•*" <br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.gov/readinci-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1022/r3/ <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

LER NUMBER <br />Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station Unit 1 <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />- 008 <br />05000 - 	 346 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />- 01 <br />YEAR <br />2016 <br />NARRATIVE <br />CORRECTIVE ACTIONS (continued): <br />Site Leadership issued a site-wide communication reaffirming the strict commitment to literal compliance with <br />DBNPS TSs. The communications identifies Senior Reactor Operators (SROs) as having primary <br />responsibility for TS compliance. Expected behaviors for the review and independent peer check of license <br />conditions was also emphasized. The communication also establishes the role of other Station and Fleet <br />personnel who may provide support to the SROs in assessing plant conditions, as having a shared <br />responsibility for understanding TS and assuring literal compliance. <br />As an immediate action, a Standing Order was issued on July 6, 2016, to reinforce the expectations for <br />review of TS and Operability Determinations, and Duty Team and Licensed Operator standards and <br />expectation. Subsequently, Fleet Operations Procedure, "Conduct of Operations", and Operations Business <br />Practice, "Conduct of Operations Handbook" was revised to improve Operator understanding and <br />implementation of the TS. Specifically, a thorough review of the entire TS LCO and TS Bases shall be <br />reviewed by both the reviewer and peer checker. An independent check shall be performed by a Licensed <br />Operator. Both of these documents include direction for conducting briefs for equipment challenges to safety, <br />risk, or reliability where no transient has occurred. <br />The standing order guidance has also been institutionalized in Fleet Operations Business Practice, <br />"Operations Briefings and Challenge Calls". This business practice was revised to include a review of each <br />Condition in its entirety for current license requirements. The review focuses on the potential for <br />entry/escalation into additibnal Conditions due to subsequent determination on an inoperable System, <br />Structure, or Component (SSC). <br />Additionally, Fleet Operations Business Practice, "First Energy Nuclear Operating Company (FENOC), Duty <br />Teams", has been revised to include the following: <br />- Expectations for Shift Manager communications to the Duty Team regarding unplanned Technical <br />Specification entries and/or emergent issues <br />- Expectations for Duty Team members regarding decision-making and any subsequent changes to a <br />decision or course of action requires consultation of the full Duty Team and other affected stakeholders <br />- An expectation to consider staffing the Outage Control Center in the event of an unplanned TS LCO less <br />than 72 hours is entered <br />- Include the use of the R.E.A.D.E (Recognize, Express, Appraise, Decide, Evaluate) Tool when <br />addressing emergent equipment issues <br />Refresher training on TS has been provided to a targeted audience of key station stakeholders including <br />select SROs (a Shift Manager, a Shift Engineer, a Unit Supervisor, and a Licensed Operator Training <br />instructor at a minimum), a Duty Team Leader, a Duty Operations Manager, and a Duty Regulatory <br />Compliance Manager. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 6 of 7 <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) tt 	 (J CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />htto://www.nrc.clov/readinci-rm/doc-collections/nureas/staff/sr1022/r3/ <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 <br />	<br />EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

The curricula shall include, at a minimum, complex TS case studies, Operability Determination and <br />Functionality Assessment including case studies and application of station procedures, case studies involving <br />the use of compensatory measures, insights to regulatory positions, and Notices of Enforcement Discretion <br />(NOED). <br />The case study that was developed to include the applicable lessons learned regarding; literal compliance <br />with TS, TS vulnerability awareness, applicability of the Operability Determination process, applicability of <br />Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.0.1, and inappropriate bias and group think tools will be presented to the <br />Supervisor Curriculum Review Committee for incorporation into the Supervisor Continuing Training Program <br />for 2017. Training shall include all licensed reactor operators. <br />PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS <br />DBNPS LER 2015-001 documents that the seismic BWST had been aligned in the past to the non-seismic <br />Spent Fuel Pool system for purification. This rendered the BWST inoperable for periods of time longer than <br />allowed per Technical Specification 3.5.4 while the plant was operating in Modes 1 through 4. However, this <br />previous condition was not associated with the SFAS transfer permissive on BWST Level - Low Low, and the <br />corrective actions taken for the previous event are not applicable to the current event. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 7 of 7<br /></span>
