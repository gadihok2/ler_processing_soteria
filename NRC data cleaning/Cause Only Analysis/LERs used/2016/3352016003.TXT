The generator lockout prevented the automatic transfer of station auxiliaries to the available startup <br />transformer power, requiring the emergency diesel generators to start and power the safety related buses. <br />Reactor coolant pumps normally powered through the non-safety buses were deenergized, and decay heat <br />removal was via natural circulation and Auxiliary Feedwater. The lockout relay actuation was caused by a latent <br />error introduced during a 2013 design modification where the maintenance configuration control procedure did not <br />prevent a wire from being inadvertently removed from the circuit. <br />Corrective actions included restoration of the affected circuit, implementation of procedure guidance to verify the <br />inadvertent energization relay state following Main Generator manual synchronization and revisions to the <br />maintenance configuration control procedure. <br />This licensee event report is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) for system actuations of <br />the reactor protection system, the emergency diesel generators and the auxiliary feedwater system. <br />This event had no effect on the health and safety of the public. <br />NCR FORM 366 (06-2016) <br />6.

FACILITY NAME <br />St. Lucie Unit 1 <br />NARRATIVE <br />Description of the Event <br />On August 21, 2016 St. Lucie Unit 1 was in in Mode 1 performing normal power ascension <br />evolutions following a maintenance outage. At 1926 EDT when the main generator [EL] <br />reached approximately 8000 amps and at 38% reactor power, unexpected actuation of the Main <br />Generator Inadvertent Energization Lockout Relay [86:EL] caused the main generator to trip, <br />resulting in an automatic reactor trip. <br />The reactor trip was complicated by the generator lockout preventing the automatic transfer of <br />station auxiliaries to the available startup transformer power, requiring the emergency diesel <br />generators to automatically start and power the safety related buses. Reactor coolant pumps <br />normally powered through the non-safety buses were deenergized, and decay heat removal <br />was via natural circulation and manual control of Auxiliary Feedwater. Due to the blocked <br />automatic transfer to the available startup transformer power, the electric driven main feedwater <br />pumps were not available until power to the non-safety related buses was restored. <br />Other than the generator lockout, all systems functioned as designed, and the plant stabilized in <br />Mode 3. <br />Operators declared a Notice of Unusual Event (NUE). The declaration of the NUE was based <br />on the lockout relay preventing the automatic transfer to available startup transformer power. <br />The transfer of power was required to be performed manually by operators following verification <br />of availability. Offsite power remained available at the switchyard throughout the event, and <br />operators restored power to the safety and non-safety related buses from the startup <br />transformers at 2036 and restarted reactor coolant pumps. The unusual event was terminated <br />at 2125 hours following restoration of forced cooling within the reactor coolant system. <br />Unit 2 was unaffected and remained at 100% power. <br />Cause <br />The direct cause of this event was a latent error introduced during a 2013 design modification <br />when a wire for the inadvertent energization lockout relay reset circuit was incorrectly removed <br />as part of a modification to the synchronization circuit. This modification allowed the relay to <br />remain energized and undetected following manual synchronization to the grid. <br />The root cause of this event was the maintenance configuration control procedure did not <br />require sufficient detail to be included in the work instructions for modifying synchronization <br />selector switch SS-888. More specifically, the maintenance configuration control procedure <br />lacked requirements to adequately document and verify the lifting and landing of the wires <br />manipulated and did not require that the as-left configuration match exactly the post <br />modification as-designed configuration. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 2 of 4 <br />6.

FACILITY NAME <br />St. Lucie Unit 1 <br />NARRATIVE <br />Analysis of the Event <br />The generator lockout relay was energized due to a missing wire in the non-safety related <br />protection relay circuit. The missing wire had been inadvertently removed during a modification <br />of the automatic synchronization system components implemented in 2013 to restore the <br />automatic synchronization capabilities of the main generator breakers. The wire that had been <br />incorrectly removed was in a section of the circuit that was not intended to be modified, and this <br />wire was not within the scope of the 2013 design modification. The missing wire caused the <br />lockout relay circuit to remain armed after manual synchronization to the grid. The discrepant <br />condition was not immediately detectable to control room operators. <br />Prior to this event, Operators were performing normal power ascension evolutions following a <br />maintenance outage. The Unit 1 main generator was manually synchronized to the electrical <br />grid. Previous synchronizations since the 2013 modification had been performed using the <br />automatic synchronization feature, which was not affected by the missing wire. Following the <br />manual synchronization on August 21, 2016, the lockout relay circuit did not reset as designed <br />but remained armed with a trip setpoint of 8000 amps through the main generator. <br />This licensee event report is being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A) as <br />“Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic actuation of any of the systems <br />listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B).” This event included automatic actuations of the reactor <br />protection system and the 1A and 1B emergency diesel generators, and manual actuation of <br />the auxiliary feedwater system. <br />Safety Significance <br />The loss of offsite power to onsite AC systems is a design basis analyzed condition; with back-<br />up systems, off normal procedures and operator training used for mitigation. <br />UFSAR section 8.3, Onsite Power System, states that in the event of a complete loss of the <br />normal offsite ac power sources, the station on-site emergency AC power system will be <br />supplied by the on-site emergency diesel generators and station batteries. The loss of offsite <br />power to the station auxiliaries is classified as an anticipated operational occurrence in UFSAR <br />section 15.2.9. The plant response to this event was similar to the design response described <br />in 15.2.9. <br />Additionally, UFSAR Table 10.5-3 indicates station compliance to General Design Criterion 44, <br />to assure redundancy of components so that under more severe conditions safety functions can <br />be performed assuming a single active component failure coincident with the loss of offsite <br />power for certain events. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 3 of 4 <br />REVISION <br />NUMBER <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 4 of 4 <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(06-2016) <br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.
