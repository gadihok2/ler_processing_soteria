At 0847, Security notified the MCR staff of the door alarm and that the door was <br />incapable of closure. At this time, both Control Room Emergency Ventilation System (CREVS) trains were <br />declared inoperable in accordance with Technical Specification (TS) 3.7.10, Condition B, due to the <br />inoperability of the Control Room Envelope (CRE). Attempts to close the door were made, and it was <br />identified that a screw had become wedged at the base of the door preventing it from latching. At 0855, the <br />screw was removed and the door verified to close as designed. CREVS was determined to be operable and <br />TS 3.7.10, Condition B was exited. <br />The screw was the bottom screw from the door latch guard and appears to have stripped loose and fallen <br />into the rubber seal around the base of the MCR door frame preventing closure of the door. Corrective <br />actions include replacing the missing screw on the door latch guard and evaluating existing preventive <br />maintenance instructions associated with CREVS boundary doors to ensure screws are tightened, as <br />needed, on a routine basis. <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />1.

PLANT OPERATING CONDITIONS BEFORE THE EVENT <br />At the time of the event, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Unit 1 and Unit 2 were in Mode 1 at 100 <br />percent rated thermal power. <br />II. DESCRIPTION OF EVENTS <br />A. Event: <br />On May 3, 2016, at 0833 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), Security received an open door [EIIS <br />Code DR] alarm [EllS Code ALM] on a Main Control Room [EIIS Code NA] (MCR) door. At <br />0847, Security notified the MCR staff that the door would not maintain its seal and would not <br />latch. Security remained in the vicinity of the door the remainder of the time it was unable to <br />close. The leak was approximately a one-eighth-inch opening across the entire sealing surface <br />[SEAL] of the door. As a result, both units entered Technical Specification (TS) 3.7.10, Control <br />Room Emergency Ventilation System [EIIS Code VI](CREVS), Condition B, due to the <br />inoperability of the Control Room Envelope (CRE). <br />During inspection of the sealing surface, a screw was found wedged under the rubber seal on <br />the bottom edge of the door. The screw was the bottom screw from the door latch guard. <br />At 0855, the screw was removed and the door was verified to close as designed. CREVS was <br />declared operable and TS 3.7.10, Condition B, was exited. <br />At 1513, an 8-hour non-emergency event notification (EN 51900) was made to the NRC in <br />accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v)(D), as an event or condition that could have prevented <br />the fulfillment of a safety function of structures or systems that are needed to mitigate the <br />consequences of an accident. This LER is submitted based on NUREG-1022, Revision 3, <br />Section 3.2.7 guidance which identifies that the requirements of 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) apply <br />when a system that is used to mitigate the consequences of an accident was declared <br />TS inoperable and no redundant system or equipment could be declared operable. Engineering <br />evaluation determined the requirement to support long term occupancy would not have been <br />affected to the point that would have resulted in exceeding the design basis dose assumptions <br />for the MCR operators. Therefore, no loss of safety function occurred. <br />The screw was the bottom screw from the door latch guard and appears to have stripped loose <br />and fallen out. <br />B. Status of structures, components, or systems that were inoperable at the start of the event <br />and contributed to the event: <br />No inoperable structures, components, or systems contributed to this event. <br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(11-2015) <br />"0" 'N. <br />Page 2 of 6 <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />1.

Dates and approximate times of occurrences: <br />Date/Time (EDT) Description <br />05/03/16, 0833 Security received an open door alarm on a MCR door. <br />05/03/16, 0847 Security notified MCR staff of the door alarm and the door was incapable <br />of closure. Both units enter TS 3.7.10, Condition B, due to the <br />inoperability of the CRE. <br />05/03/16, 0855 After investigation, a screw was found, removed, and the door verified to <br />close as designed. Both units exit TS 3.7.10, Condition B. <br />D. Manufacturer and model number of each component that failed during the event: <br />The failed component was associated with the door latch guard for the MCR door. The door <br />latch guard is model number 1625, manufactured by Precision Hardware, Inc. <br />E. Other systems or secondary functions affected: <br />There were no systems or secondary functions affected by this event. <br />F. Method of discovery of each component or system failure or procedural error: <br />Security received an open door alarm associated with the MCR door. <br />G. The failure mode, mechanism, and effect of each failed component, if known: <br />The screw that prevented the MCR door from closing was the bottom screw from the door <br />latch guard and appears to have stripped loose and fallen into the rubber seal around the <br />base of the MCR door frame preventing the door from closing. <br />H. Operator actions: <br />Following notification of the issue to the MCR operators, both CREVS trains were declared <br />inoperable in accordance with TS 3.7.10, Condition B, due to the inoperability of the CRE. MCR <br />staff contacted individuals to evaluate and repair as necessary. Additionally, mitigating actions <br />were initiated and met by verifying the availability of Potassium Iodine and self contained <br />breathing apparatus to MCR operators within the CRE. <br />I. Automatically and manually initiated safety system responses: <br />There were no automatic or manual system responses associated with this event. <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />1.

CAUSE OF THE EVENT <br />A. The cause of each component or system failure or personnel error, if known: <br />The cause of the event was the bottom screw in the door latch guard appears to have stripped <br />loose and fallen into the rubber seal around the base of the MCR door frame preventing closure <br />of the door. <br />B. The cause(s) and circumstances for each human performance related root cause: <br />There was no human performance related root cause. <br />IV. ANALYSIS OF THE EVENT <br />The CREVS is a safety related Engineered Safety Features system required to operate during design <br />basis accidents (DBAs) to mitigate the radiological consequences to the control room operators. The <br />CREVS is designed to maintain a habitable environment in the CRE for a mission time of 30 days of <br />continuous occupancy after a DBA without exceeding a 5 rem whole body dose or its equivalent to <br />any part of the body. The operability of the CRE boundary must be maintained to ensure that the <br />inleakage of unfiltered air into the CRE will not exceed the inleakage assumed in the licensing basis <br />analysis of DBA consequences to CRE occupants. Additionally, the CRE boundary ensures <br />occupants are protected from hazardous chemicals and smoke. <br />Engineering evaluation concluded that the requirement to support long term occupancy would not <br />have been affected to the point that would have resulted in exceeding the design basis dose <br />assumptions for the control room operators as the assumed unfiltered air inleakage would not have <br />been exceeded. Therefore, the CREVS and the CRE would have been able to fulfill the required 30 <br />days of continuous occupancy after a DBA. <br />V. 	 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY CONSEQUENCES <br />The temporary loss of ability to close the MCR door did not challenge nuclear or radiological <br />safety. No actual loss of safety function occurred. The CREVS maintained the ability to limit <br />MCR operator doses below the required limits. <br />A. Availability of systems or components that could have performed the same function as the <br />components and systems that failed during the event: <br />Although the MCR door was ajar, the CREVS maintained the ability to limit MCR operator <br />doses below the required limits. <br />B. For events that occurred when the reactor was shut down, availability of systems or <br />components needed to shutdown the reactor and maintain safe shutdown conditions, <br />remove residual heat, control the release of radioactive material, or mitigate the <br />consequences of an accident: <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />1.

For failure that rendered a train of a safety system inoperable, an estimate of the elapsed <br />time from discovery of the failure until the train was returned to service: <br />The elapsed time from discovery of the open door rendering the CRE inoperable until the CRE <br />was restored to operable status was 22 minutes. <br />VI. 	 CORRECTIVE ACTIONS <br />This event was entered into the Tennessee Valley Authority Corrective Action Program under <br />Condition Report (CR) 1166927. <br />A. Immediate Corrective Actions: <br />MCR Operators contacted various organizations to investigate why the door would not <br />close. During inspection of the sealing surface around the MCR door, a screw was found <br />and removed. The MCR door was closed and TS 3.7.10, Condition B, was exited for both <br />units. <br />B. Corrective actions to reduce probability of similar events occurring in the future: <br />Corrective actions include evaluating existing preventive maintenance instructions <br />associated with CREVS boundary doors to ensure screws are tightened, as needed, on a <br />routine basis. <br />Additional actions include: <br />Initiating a work order to replace the missing screw on the door latch guard. <br />VII. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION <br />A. Previous similar events at the same plant: <br />There have been no similar events at SQN in the past three years with the same underlying <br />cause. <br />B. Additional Information: <br />None. <br />C. Safety System Functional Failure Consideration: <br />This condition did not result in a safety system functional failure as defined in NEI 99-02. <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />1.
