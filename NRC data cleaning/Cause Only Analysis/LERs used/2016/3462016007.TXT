The removed PSVs were sent to an offsite vendor for testing <br />and refurbishment. In June, 2016 the test results were received showing both PSVs lifted higher than the allowed <br />one percent tolerance above the 2500 psig setpoint (2525 psig) for As-Found testing. Because both valves had As- <br />Found setpoints above the Technical Specifications (TS) allowed value, a past operability evaluation was 	 . <br />performed, which concluded that both valves were inoperable during their time in service. <br />Based on the as-found lift setting pressures (2559 psig and 2554 psig), there was no adverse effect on transients <br />described in the Updated Safety Analysis Report that can produce a Reactor Coolant System (RCS) <br />overpressurization. The cause of this event was due to setpoint drift and narrow allowable setpoint range. <br />Procedures will be revised to establish more restrictive testing requirements. The PSVs were replaced and a TS <br />change will be submitted to provide for current ASME acceptance test criteria for the PSV setpoint. This event is <br />being reported in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) and 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LER NUMBER <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />- 007 <br />Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station Unit 1 05000- 	 346 YEAR <br />2016 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />- 00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />Energy Industry Identification System (EIIS) codes are identified in the text as [XX]. <br />DESCRIPTION OF OCCURRENCE: <br />System Description: <br />The Reactor Coolant System (RCS) [AB] at the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station (DBNPS) has two <br />identical Pressurizer Safety Valves (PSV) [AB-RV], each located on a flanged nozzle on the Pressurizer [AB-<br />PZR] top head. The PSVs (valve/equipment numbers RC13A and RC13B) were manufactured by Crosby <br />Valve & Gage Company, Model Number HB-86-BP Type E series valves designed for nuclear service and <br />certified under Section III of the American Society of Mechanical Engineering (ASME) code for application in <br />nuclear power systems. The valves are designed to be self-actuating, spring loaded, with balancing bellows <br />and a balancing piston. <br />The functidn of the PSVs is to ensure the RCS pressure does not exceed the Technical Specification (TS) <br />2.1.2 Safety Limit of 2750 pounds per square inch gauge (psig). <br />Technical Specifications: <br />Technical Specification (TS) 3.4.10, "Pressurizer Safety Valves", Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) <br />3.4.10 requires two PSVs be OPERABLE with lift settings less than or equal to 2525 psig in Modes 1, 2 and <br />3. With one PSV inoperable, TS 3.4.10 Action A requires the valve be restored to operable status within 15 <br />minutes. If this required action cannot be met, or if two PSVs are inoperable, TS 3.4.10 Action B requires the <br />plant to be placed in Mode 3 within 6 hours and in Mode 4 within 12 hours. <br />DESCRIPTION OF EVENT: <br />On March 26, 2016, the DBNPS shut down for Nineteenth Refueling Outage activities. As part of this outage, <br />the two installed PSVs were removed and replaced with acceptable pre-tested spare valves under the <br />preventive maintenance program. The removed PSVs, which had been previously installed in Spring of 2014 <br />during the Eighteenth Refueling Outage, were sent to an offsite vendor for testing and refurbishment. <br />On June 21, 2016, with the plant operating in Mode 1 at 100 percent power, following receipt of final test <br />results from the vendor test facility, it was identified that both valves had As-Found lift settings above the <br />limits specified in TS 3.4.10. Because both valves had As-Found setpoints above the TS allowed value <br />(2559 psig for RC13A and 2554 psig for RC13B), a past operability evaluation was performed. The past <br />operability evaluation determined these valves were inoperable while they were installed in the plant during <br />the past operational cycle. <br />CAUSE OF EVENT: <br />The direct cause of the as-found test setpoint of the PSVs to be greater than the TS allowable value of less <br />than or equal to 2525 psig was determined to be setpoint drift. This is the same cause identified for a similar <br />failure at the DBNPS in 2011 (reference Previous Similar Events Section below). Setpoint drift cannot be <br />eliminated; however, as described in the Corrective Actions Section below, actions can be taken to minimize <br />or reduce drift. <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />	<br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />• <br />Page 2 of 4 <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LER NUMBER <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />- 007 <br />Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station Unit 1 05000 - 	 346 YEAR <br />2016 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />- 00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />CAUSE OF EVENT: (continued) <br />The root cause of this event is that the PSVs as-found allowable range of + 1/- 3 percent does not provide a <br />sufficient margin to accommodate for PSV setpoint variance. This is also similar to the contributing cause <br />identified for the 2011 failure at the DBNPS (reference Previous Similar Events Section below). <br />ANALYSIS OF EVENT: <br />While both valves had as-found setpoints that exceeded the TS allowable value, the highest out-of-tolerance <br />setpoint was 34 psig higher than the TS allowed value. <br />Both PSVs lifting at a value higher than allowed by TS may result in exceeding accident analysis RCS <br />pressure limits. Therefore, the transients described in the Updated Safety Analysis Report (USAR) that can <br />produce an RCS over-pressurization were reviewed with respect to the out-of-tolerance PSV setpoints. This <br />review concluded that both valves would have performed their design function if they would have operated at <br />their respective out-of-tolerance lift pressures. <br />The PSVs are modeled in the DBNPS Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) in two ways: a PSV fails to close <br />after opening, or one or more PSVs fail to open upon demand. Failure of a PSV to close after opening <br />results in a small loss of cooling accident. Failure of all relief capability (both PSVs and the Power Operated <br />Relief Valve) to open could result in a transient over-pressurization of the RCS, resulting in the inability to <br />inject cooling water. Failure of one or both PSVs to open limits the ability to successfully cool the plant using <br />feed and bleed cooling, since in some cases, the PSVs can be used as the RCS discharge path for this <br />cooling method. A review of the PRA concluded that neither failure mode (failure to re-close, failure to open) <br />are impacted by the identified condition. Thus, there is no impact on PRA and no increase in Core Damage <br />Frequency (CDF). The condition‘  of having the two PSVs lift at pressures slightly above the allowed setpoint <br />does not result in any increase in \CDF. Therefore, this issue had very low safety significance. Additionally, <br />this issue did not prevent the PSVs from fulfilling their design safety function. <br />Reportability Discussion: <br />NUREG-1022, Event Reporting Guidelines, states that discrepancies found in TS surveillance tests are <br />normally assumed to occur at the time of the test unless there is firm evidence, based on a review of relative <br />information, to indicate the discrepancy occurred earlier. The NUREG provides an example that multiple <br />safety valve testing failures is an indication that the discrepancies may well have arisen over a period of time <br />and did not occur just at the time of discovery. Evaluation of the PSV test history and potential failure modes <br />for the PSV did not identify any information that would allow a conclusion that the valves were operable while <br />the plant was operating in Mode 1, 2 or 3, as required by TS LCO 3.4.10. Therefore, this condition (two <br />PSVs exceeding the TS allowed setpoint) is reportable as a Licensee Event Report (LER) per 10 CFR <br />50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as an operation or condition prohibited by the plant's TS based on the above guidance from <br />NUREG-1022. <br />Additionally, because it was concluded that both PSVs were inoperable during a portion of the past <br />operational cycle, this condition is also reportable, in accordance with NUREG-1022 guidance, per 10 CFR <br />50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) as an event or condition that could have prevented fulfillment of a safety function needed to <br />mitigate the consequences of an accident.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LER NUMBER <br />NARRATIVE <br />ANALYSIS OF EVENT (Reportability Discussion continued): <br />would have performed their USAR accident mitigation design safety function if they would have operated at <br />their respective out-of-tolerance lift pressures. <br />CORRECTIVE ACTIONS: <br />Completed Actions: <br />During the Nineteenth Refueling Outage concluding in May 2016, two PSVs were installed in place of the <br />removed valves as part of planned preventive maintenance activities. The installed valves, identical to the <br />removed valves, had As-Left set pressures of approximately 2495 psig for both PSVs. <br />Scheduled Actions: <br />As discussed in the cause analysis section above, setpoint drift cannot be eliminated; however, actions can <br />be taken to minimize or reduce drift. Therefore, changes will be made to the PSV testing procedure(s) to <br />provide actions for improving valve repeatability by establishing more restrictive PSV main spring <br />requirements and requiring three (3) consecutive lifts as part of as-left testing. <br />Extensive industry operating experience research from this event's evaluation, coupled with the previous <br />DBNPS LER 2011-001 discussed below, has shown that a prudent action to address the root cause is to <br />propose a License Amendment Request to change the TS 3.4.10 limit from less than or equal to 2525 psig to <br />less than or equal to 2575 psig to facilitate the ASME acceptance criteria of +1- 3 percent for as-found testing. <br />The industry operating experience review from this event's evaluation indicates the DBNPS is an exception in <br />not having changed the DBNPS TS licensing basis to the current ASME +1- 3 percent as-found test criteria. <br />PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS <br />DBNPS LER 2011-001, "Pressurizer Code Safety Valve Setpoint Test Failures," was submitted on March 11, <br />2011, to document an occurrence where both PSVs removed during the Sixteenth Refueling Outage in <br />Spring of 201.0 had exceeded the TS allowed value with the highest out-of-tolerance setpoint of 10 psig <br />higher than the required value. As discussed above in the cause analysis section, the causes were the same <br />or similar to this event. The same [direct] cause of the 2011 test failure was determined to be setpoint drift, <br />and the contributing cause was similar to this event's root cause. Additionally, the operating experience <br />review from the 2016 test failure, suggest other licensees have changed their TS acceptance criteria. The <br />2011 corrective action focused on PSV testing improvements, such as establishing a strictly adhered to as-<br />left test tolerance requirement, which was shown to be effective in testing performed following the <br />Seventeenth Mid-Cycle Outage and the Eighteenth Refueling Outage. <br />Page 4 of 4 <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015)<br /></span>
