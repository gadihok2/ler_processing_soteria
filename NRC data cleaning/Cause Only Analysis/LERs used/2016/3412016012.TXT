The current analysis assumes that the fission products released as a result of a CRDA are transported to the condenser <br />and then released from there. An unanalyzed condition was identified where a forced release from the Gland Seal Exhausters (GSEs) <br />could occur which would exceed dose limits in 10 CFR 100.11 and Standard Review Plan 6.4 when operating at low reactor power <br />conditions. The postulated fuel damage and associated release is only credible for low power conditions of less than 10% power. Fermi <br />2 was at 97% power at the time of discovery and, therefore, the condition did not exist. I lowever, a review of past operating conditions <br />identified five instances in the past three years where Fermi 2 operated at less than 10% power. Based on a subsequent engineering <br />analysis, for each of those five instances, plant conditions and available equipment were such that dose limits would have been met even <br />if a postulated CRDA had occurred during those times; therefore, there was no adverse impact to public health and safety or to plant <br />employees. There were no radiological releases. The cause of the event was that the original design and licensing basis analysis of the <br />CRDA did not evaluate the direct release of steam from the GSEs, and, therefore, the plant was not designed to mitigate the potential <br />consequences associated with that release path. For corrective actions, the plant startup checklist was revised to impose restrictions on <br />future startups based on the engineering analysis. Fermi 2 plans to pursue modifications which would eliminate this potential release <br />path. <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016) <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(06-2016) <br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.govireading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1022/r31)   <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

The non-conservatism was identified at approximately 1030 EDT <br />while operating in MODE 1 at 97% power. <br />The current CRDA analysis, which is based on Standard Review Plan (SRP) 15.4.9, postulates that radioactive fission <br />products are released as a result of the control rod drop and the released activity transports directly to the condenser and <br />is released at ground level from the turbine building at the rate of 1% of the condenser volume per day for one day. Doses <br />reported in the current licensing basis analysis demonstrate offsite radiological consequences are well within (less than <br />25% of) the Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 100.11 siting criteria. The current licensing basis was <br />approved without specific evaluation of Main Control Room (MCR) [[NA]] personnel dose. <br />Per Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) Section 6.4, the functional design of the habitability systems ensure <br />compliance with 10 CFR 50 Appendix A General Design Criterion (GDC) 19 and that "[u]nder any design-basis conditions, <br />the environment within the main control room is safe, with personnel protected from radiation, fire, toxic gases, and <br />noxious substances." Sufficient radiation shielding and air filtration are provided to ensure that radiation exposures of <br />MCR personnel do not exceed 5 rem whole-body, or its equivalent to any part of the body, for the duration of a design <br />basis accident (DBA). For the DBA Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) and the Fuel Handling Accident, the dose to main <br />control room personnel does not exceed 5 rem total effective dose equivalent (TEDE). <br />The Control Room Emergency Filtration (CREF) [[VI]] system is an Engineered Safety Feature (ESF) designed to limit <br />radiation exposure to personnel occupying the MCR to less than 5 rem over the duration of a DBA as required by 10 CFR <br />50.67 and 10 CFR 50 Appendix A Criterion 19. This function is accomplished by 1) isolating normal unfiltered intakes, 2) <br />directing emergency makeup air through charcoal and High Efficiency Particulate Air (NEPA) filters [[FLT]], 3) re-<br />circulating control room and makeup air through HEPA and charcoal filters, and 4) maintaining the Control Room <br />Envelope (CRE) under a positive pressure with respect to the outside environs to prevent the in-leakage of unfiltered <br />outside air. CRE integrity is necessary to minimize potential unfiltered in-leakage thereby supporting the operation of the <br />Control Center Heating Ventilating and Air Conditioning (CCHVAC) [[VI]] and CREF systems in their function to protect the <br />health and safety of control room operators post-accident. <br />As described above, the radiological consequences of the CRDA were re-evaluated to support a potential license <br />amendment. The results of the new analysis, which were obtained in accordance with current regulatory guidance that <br />has been updated from the original NUREG 75/087 Section 15.4.9 Fermi 2 licensing basis, predict onsite and offsite <br />radiological consequences that exceed the current applicable regulatory dose limits in 10 CFR 100.11 and SRP 6.4 (GDC <br />19). The increase in calculated radiological consequences is attributable to the consideration of a forced release via the <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page <br />	 2 	 of 	 5 <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />	<br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(06-2016) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.00vireading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1022/13/)   <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

This release path was not explicitly evaluated under the original plant design <br />and licensing basis; however, its consideration is consistent with current NRC Regulatory Guides (RGs) 1.183 (regarding <br />Alternate Source Term (AST) methods) and 1.195 (regarding non-AST methods) as well as industry precedent. Under <br />normal full power operating conditions, the fraction of total steam production delivered to the GSEs is small (less than <br />0.2%). However, at low reactor power, when the consequences of a postulated CRDA are credible, the fraction of gland <br />sealing steam relative to total steam production is relatively large (2-20%). Furthermore, this path does not benefit from <br />iodine holdup and NRC precedent does not allow credit for iodine washout for this path. Consequently, the modeled <br />release is greater than regulatory dose limits. Performed as directed by SRP 15.4.9, the current plant CRDA analysis <br />evaluates only the consequences associated with a 1% volume/day release from the main condenser and includes credit <br />for iodine retention in the vessel and main condenser. These are removal mechanisms that significantly reduce the <br />consequences of the release. The only forced release path that is considered is that associated with the mechanical <br />vacuum pumps (MVPs). However, the MVPs are provided with an automatic trip on Offgas 2-Minute Delay Pipe HI-HI <br />Radiation that is credited to mitigate consequences from this forced release path. The release path from the GSEs was <br />not evaluated and an automatic trip of the GSEs was not provided. Although UFSAR Section 15.4.9 does not evaluate or <br />report MCR operator doses, UFSAR Section 6.4 states that the habitability design of the main control room is adequate to <br />protect the control room personnel for all accidents. <br />There is no degraded component. Rather, the condition is being treated as the result of an inadequate design and <br />licensing basis. The results of the updated analysis establish that in the absence of an installed means of rapidly and <br />automatically terminating the release associated with the GSEs, regulatory dose limits are exceeded unless credit is taken <br />for assumptions and features not currently part of the licensing basis, such as more realistic input assumptions regarding <br />core source term and existing installed methods of mitigation, such as Main Steam Isolation Valve (MSIV) [[ISV]] isolation <br />and operation of the CREF system. <br />The condition is specific to the analysis of the CRDA for which the postulated fuel damage occurs at time zero and <br />resultant activity instantaneously transports to the coolant in the reactor vessel. Reactor fuel damage associated with <br />other accidents such as the DBA LOCA occurs on a time scale that is longer than the time required for isolation of the <br />steam lines and a release via the GSEs is not postulated to occur. On this basis, the condition is only applicable to the <br />CRDA. In addition, the postulated fuel damage resulting from the CRDA is only credible during low-power (less than 10%) <br />MODE 1 and 2 operation during a plant startup. With increasing power, the severity of the rod drop reactivity insertion is <br />reduced such that the expected peak enthalpy is much less than the design limit at 10% power even if the worst <br />conceivable or maximum worth control rod is dropped from the core. Consistent with this expected power dependence of <br />the consequences of the CRDA, the Rod Worth Minimizer is required to be operable for a reactor power less than or equal <br />to 10% (per Technical Specification Table 3.3.2.1-1). The lower the assumed power level, the larger the source term <br />fraction associated with gland sealing steam. The results of the updated CRDA analysis demonstrate that the <br />consequences of CRDA lessen as the assumed power level increases due to the fact that as steam production increases, <br />an increasing fraction of the source term is directed to the condenser where it is held up and decayed, and released at a <br />reduced rate. <br />At the time of the discovery, Fermi 2 was operating at 97% power. Therefore, the plant condition was bounded by the <br />design and licensing basis such that the condition did not exist at the time of discovery. No immediate actions were <br />required. However, Fermi 2 had operated at low reactor power levels during startup several times in the past three years. <br />A past operability review for the three years prior to November 2, 2016 was performed to identify when Fermi 2 had <br />operated at the relevant power levels (i.e. less than 10%).

The duration in the relevant <br />power range was approximately three days. <br />2) At approximately 1730 EDT on April 21, 2014, Fermi 2 entered MODE 2 following an outage.

The duration in the relevant power range was <br />approximately two days. <br />3) At approximately 0730 EDT on April 3, 2015, Fermi 2 entered MODE 2 following an outage. Power remained below <br />10% during startup until after approximately 0730 EDT on April 4, 2015. The duration in the relevant power range was <br />approximately one day. <br />4) At approximately 1300 EST on November 25, 2015, Fermi 2 entered MODE 2 following a refueling outage. Power <br />remained below 10% during startup until after approximately 0730 EST on November 28, 2015. The duration in the <br />relevant power range was approximately three days. <br />5) At approximately 1630 EDT on May 12, 2016, Fermi 2 entered MODE 2 following an outage. Power remained below <br />10% during startup until after approximately 1930 EDT on May 13, 2016. The duration in the relevant power range was <br />approximately one day. <br />The five periods identified above where Fermi 2 was operating in MODE 1 or 2 below 10% power represent potential <br />unanalyzed conditions where the occurrence of a CRDA during those periods could have resulted in offsite and main <br />control room doses exceeding regulatory limits. Therefore, this Licensee Event Report (LER) is being made under 10 <br />CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B) as an "event or condition that resulted in the nuclear power plant being in an unanalyzed condition <br />that significantly degraded plant safety." An 8-hour non-emergency Event Notification (EN 52342) was previously made <br />under the corresponding requirement in 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B). <br />Subsequent to discovery but prior to the date of this LER, Fermi 2 entered MODE 2 on November 11, 2016 following an <br />outage that began on November 7, 2016. This startup was performed in accordance with plant procedures which had <br />been revised based on an engineering analysis, described in detail below, and was, therefore, not an unanalyzed <br />condition. <br />SIGNIFICANT SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS <br />An engineering analysis was performed to evaluate the safety consequences and implications. The analysis took credit <br />for assumptions and features that, while justified, are not currently part of the licensing basis. Regarding offsite doses, the <br />analysis determined that crediting automatic closure of the MSIVs during the CRDA is sufficient to ensure offsite doses <br />remain within the limits of 10 CFR 100.11 and the more restrictive SRP 15.4.9 requirement that consequences for the <br />CRDA remain less 25% of the Part 100 limits. Crediting MSIV closure is reasonable because it is an available ESF <br />controlled by Technical Specifications (TS 3.3.6.1). Additional margin to these limits exists when typical post-shutdown <br />decay of the core source term and post-scram reduction in steam flow are considered. Regarding MCR doses, the <br />analysis took credit for automatic closure of the MSIVs as described previously and also for operation of the CREF since it <br />is also an available ESF controlled by Technical Specifications (TS 3.7.3). Credit for these features alone was insufficient <br />to ensure operator consequences within SRP 6.4. However, credit for these features in conjunction with either of the <br />following conservatisms was sufficient to ensure that current NRC acceptance limits were met: <br />• Credit for the last as-found control room unfiltered in-leakage, which is nearly one-half the current 173 cfm design value <br />• Source term decay due to normal post-shutdown delay greater than 5.1 days in startup (normally days to weeks for any <br />shutdown from full power) <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(06-2016) <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.govireading-rm/doc-collectionsinuregs/staff/sr1022/r3/)   <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 	 4 	 of 	 5 <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(06-2016) <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.gov/read ino-rm/d oc-collections/nuregs/staff/srl 022/r3/)  <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 <br />	<br />EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

Revision 3 of SRP 6.4 currently allows adoption of a higher thyroid <br />dose limit of 50 rem for current operating reactors conforming to and implementing the guidance of RG 1.195 in <br />conjunction with RG 1.196. Since the analysis was performed in accordance with those RGs, the higher 50 rem thyroid <br />dose limit was adopted for the analysis. <br />This LER identified five instances in the past three years that represented unanalyzed conditions. In each of those <br />instances, the plant was in the relevant power range (i.e. less than 10%) during startup following an outage. The duration <br />that the plant was shut down prior to startup was greater than 5.1 days for each of the five instances. Therefore, the <br />actual plant condition for these five instances met the second bullet identified above such that MCR doses for a postulated <br />CRDA would have met NRC acceptance limits. Note that credit for either one of the bulleted items is sufficient to provide <br />adequate mitigation; however, both may be in effect, which provides additional margin. In addition, washout of iodine in <br />the gland seal exhaust condenser, which would also significantly reduce the release of iodine, was not credited in the <br />evaluation. <br />In conclusion, the engineering analysis determined that even if a postulated CRDA had occurred during the three years <br />prior to the discovery of this unanalyzed condition, all relevant dose acceptance criteria for both offsite and MCR doses <br />would have been met based on the plant condition and available ESF equipment at the time. Therefore, there was no <br />adverse impact to public health and safety or to plant employees. There were no radiological releases. <br />CAUSE OF THE EVENT <br />The cause was that the original design and licensing basis analysis of the Fermi 2 DBA CRDA described in UFSAR <br />Section 15.4.9 was performed in accordance with the prescribed methods and assumptions of NRC SRP 15.4.9 that did <br />not evaluate the direct release of nuclear steam from the GSEs as significant. As a result, the plant was not designed to <br />mitigate the potential consequences associated with this release path. <br />CORRECTIVE ACTIONS <br />As discussed previously, no immediate action was required to restore compliance since the condition did not exist at the <br />time of discovery. As a long-term corrective action, Fermi 2 plans to implement modifications to eliminate this potential <br />CRDA release path. To prevent future occurrence of an unanalyzed condition in the interim until the modification is <br />complete, the Post Outage Startup Checklist was revised on November 10, 2016, to impose restrictions on the plant <br />startup based on the engineering analysis described above. This checklist was utilized during the plant startup that was <br />begun on November 11, 2016. <br />PREVIOUS OCCURRENCES <br />No similar previous occurrences were identified. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 	 5 	 of 	 5<br /></span>
