This event was a momentary inoperability of secondary <br />containment integrity, which is an 8 hour reportable event. The Resident Inspector was notified, and an Event <br />Notification made pursuant to 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v)(C). (Reference EN#52022). Following the event, the door <br />controls were adjusted and verified to function properly. On June 29, 2016, at 100% power, workers opened two <br />doors concurrently when entering a secondary containment access airlock. The individuals promptly closed their <br />respective doors. The event was a brief inoperability of secondary containment integrity as above, notifications were <br />made, and repairs completed. (Reference EN#52053) <br />The root causes were determined to be inadequate procedural guidance and equipment design not being able to <br />prevent the simultaneous opening of an inner and outer door at all times, under all possible conditions. Corrective <br />actions include modification of the interlock tests, and replacement of key door interlock components. <br />These events did not result in a safety system functional failure. There were no radiological releases associated with <br />these events. <br />NRC FORM 366 (02-2014) <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(02-2014) <br />	  <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 01/31/2017 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours. <br />Reported lessons learned are incorporated into the licensing process and fed back to industry. <br />Send comments regarding burden estimate to the FOIA, Privacy and Information Collections <br />Branch (T-5 F53), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, or by <br />intemet e-mail to Infocollects.Resource@nrc.gov, and to the Desk Officer, Office of Information <br />and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB-10202, (3150-0104), Office of Management and Budget, <br />Washington, DC 20503.

Description of Event: <br />On June 19, 2016 at 1533, while operating at 82% power, the Control Room Supervisor (CRS) was <br />notified that Door-281 and Door-282, both in Secondary Containment Airlock 153, had been opened <br />concurrently during performance of STP 3.6.4.1-02, "Secondary Containment Airlock Verification," <br />Revision 15, Step 7.1.1.e. This step directed the technician to attempt to open the inner door while <br />the outer door was open The doors being open at the same time caused a failure to meet SR <br />3.6.4.1.2 to verify that either the outer door(s) or the inner door(s) in each Secondary Containment <br />access opening are closed. The identified condition caused Secondary Containment to be <br />considered inoperable per TS LCO 3.6.4.1. The technician involved immediately closed the doors <br />upon encountering this unexpected condition. This action allowed SR 3.6.4.1.2 to be met, and <br />restored Secondary Containment to an operable status. <br />On June 29, 2016 at 0940, while operating at 100% power, the CRS was notified that Door-<br />239A and Door-246, both in Secondary Containment Airlock 222, the Reactor Building <br />Railroad Airlock, had been opened concurrently. The doors being open at the same time <br />caused a failure to meet SR 3.6.4.1.2 to verify that either the outer door(s) or the inner <br />door(s) in each Secondary Containment access opening are closed. The identified condition <br />caused Secondary Containment to be considered inoperable per TS LCO 3.6.4.1. The <br />individuals involved immediately closed their respective doors upon encountering this <br />unexpected condition. This action allowed SR 3.6.4.1.2 to be met, and restored Secondary <br />Containment to an operable status. <br />Each of the above events resulted in an 8 hour reportable event. In both cases, the Resident <br />Inspector was notified, and an Event Notification was made pursuant to 10 CFR <br />50.72(b)(3)(v)(C). (References EN #52022 and EN #52053). Secondary containment leak <br />tightness is required to ensure that the release of radioactive materials from the primary <br />containment is restricted to those leakage paths and associated leakage rates assumed in <br />the accident analysis and that fission products entrapped within the secondary containment <br />structure will be treated by the Standby Gas Treatment System prior to discharge to the <br />environment. <br />A Secondary Containment door airlock utilizes an interlock device with an adjustable <br />permanent magnet (mounted on the door), and an electromagnet (on the door frame) <br />arranged in an electrical circuit so that door(s) are held closed and/or are allowed to open <br />after a pushbutton is depressed. <br />Immediately following the event on June 19, troubleshooting adjusted an interlock magnet <br />and by 1651 hours post-maintenance testing had been performed satisfactorily per <br />Surveillance Test Procedure (STP) 3.6.4.1-02, Secondary Containment Airlock Verification. <br />Duane Arnold Energy Center <br />NRC FORM 366A (02-2014) <br />1.

SHEET <br />NARRATIVE <br />Immediately following the event on June 29, troubleshooting found the electromagnet on Door-239A <br />was not consistently locking the door due to loose fasteners, and the pushbutton contacts of Door-<br />246 were fouled, causing intermittent actuation of the door logic. The Door-239A fasteners were <br />tightened and at 1108 hours post-maintenance testing was performed satisfactorily per Surveillance <br />Test Procedure (STP) 3.6.4.1-02, Secondary Containment Airlock Verification. The Door-246 <br />pushbuttons were subsequently replaced. <br />There were no radiological releases associated with these two events. There were no other <br />structures, systems or components inoperable at the start of either event that contributed to <br />the event. <br />II. Assessment of Safety Consequences: <br />There were no actual safety consequences associated with these events; the potential safety <br />consequences were minimal. In each case, both doors on the airlock were open simultaneously for <br />less than 10 seconds, and were able to be closed immediately upon discovery of the condition. There <br />were no radiological releases associated with these events. <br />These events will not be reported as safety system functional failures as engineering analysis has <br />determined the system is capable of performing its safety function during events when the airlock is <br />open for less than 10 seconds. The site's post-LOCA dose calculation does not credit secondary <br />containment integrity for mitigation of on-site and off-site doses for the first 5 minutes of the event. <br />Therefore, these events are bounded by the existing dose calculation. <br />Neither event resulted in a safety system functional failure. There were no automatically or manually <br />initiated safety system responses. <br />III. Cause of Event: <br />Technical Specifications Surveillance Requirement SR 3.6.4.1.2 requires one inner or one outer <br />secondary containment airlock door to be closed at all times. A Root Cause Evaluation was <br />conducted in August 2016 which determined the root causes of the events on June 19 and 29, <br />2016 were: <br />• (June 19) Inadequate procedural guidance which directed the user to attempt to open one <br />airlock door while the other was already open (i.e., in effect, the user was instructed to <br />actively challenge the door interlocks). <br />• (June 29) The secondary containment breach due to simultaneous opening of airlock <br />doors was attributed to the equipment design not being able to prevent the simultaneous <br />opening of one inner and one outer door at all times, under all possible conditions. <br />NRC FORM 366A (02-2014) <br />1.

Corrective Actions: <br />The corrective actions to preclude recurrence of the June 19, 2016 event have been completed. <br />These are: <br />• Modification of STP 3.6.4.1-02, the Secondary Containment Airlock Verification surveillance <br />procedure, to perform the interlock test with one of the two doors closed at all times. <br />• Removal of the airlock interlock logic testing from STP 3.6.4.1-02. <br />Additional corrective actions will include development of new Preventive Maintenance (PM) actions <br />that will perform the interlock logic testing and maintenance removed from STP 3.6.4.1-02 (above) <br />without challenging the secondary containment. Implementation of this PM will be on a schedule and <br />frequency commensurate with door use. <br />As noted, for the June 29, 2016 event the Door-239A fasteners were tightened, which allowed for <br />successful completion of the surveillance test. Interim and compensatory corrective actions for the <br />event have also been completed. These were replacement of the Door-246 pushbuttons and the <br />installation of cameras at the Railroad Airlock (Airlock 222) doors, with monitors showing the view of <br />the opposite camera. Personnel had been previously instructed on how to use the monitors when <br />they were installed at the Reactor Building Access Control Airlock in 2015. <br />The corrective actions to preclude recurrence of the June 29, 2016 event will be the following: <br />• Door entry pushbuttons and key logic relays at high traffic airlocks will be replaced. <br />• Enamel will be added to permanent magnets at high traffic doors to assist in <br />reducing/preventing magnet rotation. <br />Completion of the above actions will be tracked by the site Corrective Action Program. <br />NRC FORM 366A (02-2014) <br />1.
