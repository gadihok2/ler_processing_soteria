At 1137 hours, during review of industry operating experience, an issue was identified for the potential <br />impact of low barometric pressure associated with a tornado on the Emergency Diesel Generators (EDGs). The <br />EDGs are equipped with a crankcase positive pressure trip with a set point of approximately 1 inch of water. It was <br />determined that a design basis tornado could create sufficient low pressure to potentially actuate the crankcase <br />positive pressure trip due to different vent paths between the EDG Room and the EDG crankcase. If the crankcase <br />pressure trip occurs before the EDG starts on an emergency signal due to the tornado, the crankcase pressure trip <br />would cause an EDG lockout. The EDG lockout would then prevent either an EDG normal or emergency start until <br />operators could manually reset the lockout. This condition could potentially affect both EDGs simultaneously. <br />This was an original EDG protective logic circuitry design issue that did not anticipate the interaction between the <br />crankcase pressure trip and the outside atmospheric pressure. Corrective actions included temporarily disabling <br />this trip and longer-term plant modification to make the change permanent. <br />This event is being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B), and <br />10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(A) through (D). <br />• <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

Each EDG is designed to start and reach stabilized voltage <br />and frequency within ten seconds after receiving the starting signal. Upon receiving an emergency start <br />signal from Safety Feature Actuation Signal (SFAS) [JE] or on a loss of essential bus voltage, the EDG is <br />automatically isolated and loaded according to a predetermined sequence. All safety loads are assumed to <br />be loaded within 35 seconds including the 10-second starting interval. <br />Each diesel engine is a General Motors, Bruce, 2-cycle, 20-cylinder, turbocharged diesel. Each engine <br />drives a generator, which is nominally rated for 2600 kilowatts continuous electric service. <br />Each EDG is equipped with mechanical and electrical interlocks to ensure personnel protection and to <br />prevent or limit equipment damage. During a non-emergency diesel generator operation (for example, on-<br />line testing) each of the EDGs is provided with mechanical and electrical protective devices capable of <br />initiating an EDG trip. However, during an emergency operation, namely on a loss of essential bus voltage <br />or an SFAS Level 2, controls limit the EDG trip to generator differential relay action and engine overspeed. <br />This measure is taken to minimize the possibility of the protective devices needlessly preventing the EDG <br />from operating when required, as during a Design Basis Accident. However, alarms are still provided for <br />high crankcase pressure, low lube oil pressure, high engine temperature, and electrical protective relays. <br />Mechanical protection is provided for the EDG engine by monitoring crankcase pressure to protect the <br />engine from damage. If crankcase pressure increases above the setpoint of 1 inch of water gauge (WG) <br />(with a range of 0.8 to 3 inches WG), the engine will trip and a local alarm will be actuated. The trip function is <br />bypassed by an EDG emergency start signal. The EDG High Crankcase Pressure Switches [PS] are <br />pressure-sensitive devices used to determine abnormal condition of the crankcase. A negative pressure is <br />normally maintained in the crankcase with the engine running. When the EDG is in standby, the crankcase <br />directly communicates with the EDG exhaust and the crankcase pressure would be similar to atmospheric <br />pressure outside of the EDG Rooms in the Auxiliary Building. Therefore, if the pressure of the EDG rooms <br />would be 0.8 inches WG less than the pressure in the crankcase, the EDG High Crankcase Pressure <br />Switches could trip. <br />Each EDG is provided with storage tanks having a fuel oil capacity sufficient to operate that diesel for a <br />period of 7 days following a Loss of Offsite Power. This onsite fuel oil capacity is based on the fact that 7 <br />days is sufficient time to replenish the onsite tank inventory from outside sources. Additionally, one non-<br />class 1 E diesel generator can be aligned to power either 4160 Volt essential bus in the event of a station <br />blackout. <br />Page 2 of 5 <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION r <br />(11-2015) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

With one EDG <br />inoperable, the Operability of the remaining A.C. sources must be demonstrated by performing Surveillance <br />Requirement 3.8.1.1 (verification of correct breaker alignments and indicated power availability) within one <br />hour and at least once per 8 hours thereafter and by performing Surveillance Requirement 3.8.1.2 <br />(verification that the Operable EDG starts and accelerates up to 900 rpm) within 24 hours. Two EDGs must <br />be restored to Operable status within 7 days or the plant must be in Hot Standby (Mode 3) within the next 6 <br />hours and in Cold Shutdown (Mode 5) completed within 36 hours. With two EDGs inoperable, the <br />Operability of one EDG must be restored within 2 hours or the plant must be in Hot Standby (Mode 3) within <br />the next 6 hours and in Cold Shutdown (Mode 5) completed within 36 hours. <br />DESCRIPTION OF EVENT: <br />An industry operating experience report in June 2016 identified the potential for differential pressure changes <br />caused by a tornado to actuate the plant's EDG High Crankcase Pressure switches during normal, stand-by <br />mode, locking-out the EDGs prior to receiving an emergency mode start signal. <br />Review of the DBNPS Auxiliary Building Tornado Depressurization calculation on June 16, 2016, determined <br />the specific scenario had not been previously considered, and the calculated pressure differences between <br />the EDG rooms and outside atmosphere caused by a design basis tornado could exceed the EDG High <br />Crankcase Pressure Switch setting of 1 inch WG (nominal), creating the same situation at the DBNPS. <br />The scenario assumes a tornado lowers atmospheric pressure in both EDG rooms, and the pressure inside <br />the engines remains slightly higher, such that the high crankcase pressure switches trip. Although the <br />crankcase pressure trips are bypassed on an emergency start of the engines, the scenario assumes the trips <br />happen before the EDGs are required to start fora Loss of Offsite power (or other bus undervoltage <br />condition). The DBNPS review of the operating experience concluded this scenario could possibly cause the <br />differential pressure necessary to trip the crankcase pressure switches on the DBNPS EDGs. A trip of the <br />crankcase pressure switches, while in standby, causes actuation of the shutdown relays, which in turn <br />causes engine lockouts, keeping the EDGs from being able to start during an emergency condition. <br />CAUSE OF EVENT <br />The original design of the EDGs' protective devices did not anticipate the interaction between the High <br />Crankcase Pressure switch and atmospheric pressure outside of the EDG Rooms of the Auxiliary Building <br />during a tornado event. Additionally, there were no means to bypass or delay a trip signal in normal, stand-<br />by mode which contributed to the susceptibility of the High Crankcase Pressure switch to possibly actuate <br />during a tornado event. <br />Neither the DBNPS nor, others in the nuclear industry recognized that differential pressures due to a tornado <br />could actuate an EDG High Crankcase Pressure Switch until this recent industry operating experience <br />discovery. <br />Page 3 of 5 <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LER NUMBER <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />- 006 <br />Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station Unit 1 05000 - 	 346 YEAR <br />2016 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />- 00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />ANALYSIS OF EVENT: <br />This issue is considered to have at most a substantial safety significance. The delta Core Damage <br />Frequency (CDF) of 3.42E-05, when calculated and using the most conservative assumptions is within the <br />substantial safety significance range of significance. However, the conservative assumptions include any <br />tornados striking the site would lockout the DBNPS EDGs because of this condition. <br />The conservative nature of this assumption is evidenced by the fact that the tornado which did strike the <br />facility in June 1998 did not result in an EDG lockout. As a result, sensitivity studies using less conservative <br />probabilities that a tornado would travel the specific path needed to lockout the EDGs were <br />performed. These studies show that the delta CDF could be as low as 5.8E-07, which is within the very low <br />safety significance range. Also, credit was not taken for operator actions to reset the EDGs. If an operator <br />action with a 1 percent failure rate is taken into consideration, the delta CDF would be 5.8E-07, which is <br />within the very low safety significance range. Combining both operator action credit (1 percent failure rate) <br />with less conservative tornado pathing (1 percent chance to cause the condition) results in a delta CDF of <br />2.4E-07, which is within the very low safety significance range. <br />Additionally, since the EDG crankcase pressure lockout is bypassed during an emergency start, it may be <br />assumed that the tornado does not cause a loss of offsite power as it approaches the site in order for this <br />scenario to occur. The prevailing winds at the site and tornados in this geographical area, generally travel <br />from West to East. It is likely that the switchyard and/or offsite power sources would be disabled prior to the <br />tornado impacting the EDG Rooms and actuating the crankcase pressure switches. It is also noted that in the <br />past 3 years, there has only been one tornado in Ottawa County, Ohio, which occurred on November 17, <br />2013. The tornado was classified as an EF1 and was never within 11 miles of the site. <br />Reportability Discussion: <br />The EDG crankcase pressure switch actuation due to pressure differentials during a tornado event is an <br />unanalyzed condition and because it affects both EDGs simultaneously, it would affect all safety related <br />onsite AC power. Therefore, this condition represents an unanalyzed condition that significantly degrades <br />plant safety, and therefore is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(ii)(B). The NRC was verbally notified of this <br />event per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(ii)(B) at 1459 hours on June 16, 2016, via Event Number 52010. <br />A further review of this condition, concluded that because this condition was present from the original design <br />and affected both EDGs simultaneously, coupled with the complexity of the tornado / Auxiliary Building <br />analysis, there was not sufficient evidence to support a reasonable expectation that either EDG could have <br />performed their safety function in the past if a design basis tornado had struck the Davis-Besse site. <br />Because this condition would have affected both of the EDGs simultaneously, this condition is reportable per <br />10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v) as a condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of a <br />system needed to: (A) shutdown the reactor and maintain it in a safe shutdown condition; (B) remove <br />residual heat; (C) control the release of radioactive material; and (D) mitigate the consequences of an <br />accident. <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />	<br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />so 	 CONTINUATION SHEET <br />Page 4 of 5 <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

As noted in the Prompt Operability <br />Determination, the engine vendor has agreed that removal of the Crankcase Pressure Relay/trip relay does not <br />adversely impact engine operation. <br />An Operations Standing Order was developed and issued on June 17, 2016, to provide direction to the <br />operators to implement the compensatory measure during weather conducive to the formation of a tornado <br />as identified by notification of a locally declared Tornado Watch or Warning. <br />A temporary modification was developed and implemented on June 25, 2016, to disable the EDG Crankcase <br />Pressure Switch trip function for EDG 1 and 2. <br />Scheduled Actions: <br />A modification will be developed to permanently disable the EDG High Crankcase Pressure switches trip <br />logic. <br />PREVIOUS SIMILAR EVENTS <br />There have been no LERs at the DBNPS in the past three years involving the inoperability of the Emergency <br />Diesel Generators or latent system design issues. <br />Page 5 of 5 <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015)<br /></span>
