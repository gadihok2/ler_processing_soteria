Subsequently at 11:41 hours, RCIC was declared inoperable due to a water leak from the <br />lube oiler cooler lower flange. <br />During investigation it was determined that valve RCIC-AOV-PCV23, which was replaced during Refueling Outage <br />29, was full open causing excessive cooling water pressure to the lube oil cooler. This valve regulates cooling water <br />to the lube oil cooler. Initial examination revealed that the actuator was purchased with a closed travel stop instead <br />of the required open travel stop. The work order was revised to fabricate and install an open travel stop. On <br />November 10, 2016, following valve modification, RCIC passed surveillance testing, was declared operable, and TS <br />LCO 3.5.3, Condition A, exited. <br />:The root cause evaluation determined that the correct air operated valve was not purchased because the material <br />master purchase order text and associated drawing didn't detail the requirement of an open travel stop. <br />To prevent recurrence, CNS will revise the material master purchase order text to state that the valve includes a <br />travel stop in the open direction to limit valve travel. In addition, the drawing will be modified to show the correct <br />travel stop with a note emphasizing the design function of the travel stop. <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016 <br />Page 2 of 3 <br />NRC FORM 366 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />(See Page 2 for required number of digits/characters for each block) <br />(See NUREG-1022, R 3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.govireading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr10221r31)  <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours. <br />Reported lessons learned are incorporated into the licensing process and fed back to industry.

LER NUMBER 2. DOCKET NUMBER <br />05000- 298 <br />1. FACILITY NAME <br />Cooper Nuclear Station <br />NARRATIVE <br />PLANT STATUS <br />Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS) was in Mode 1, Power Operation, at approximately 10 percent power, at <br />the time of the event. <br />BACKGROUND <br />The Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) [EllS:BN] system provides makeup water to the reactor <br />pressure vessel (RPV) [EIIS:RPV] following an RPV isolation in order to prevent the release of <br />radioactive materials to the environs as a result of inadequate core cooling. <br />The RCIC system consists of a steam driven turbine-pump unit [EIIS:TRB, P], piping, and valves [EllS:V] <br />to provide steam to the turbine, as well as piping and valves to transfer water from the suction sources to <br />the core via the Feedwater [El IS:SJ] system line, where the coolant is distributed within the RPV. The <br />RCIC system pump supply is normally aligned to the Emergency Condensate Storage Tanks. The pump <br />discharge is normally isolated and valve operation is required to align in either RPV injection mode or <br />test return mode. Upon receipt of an initiation signal, the RCIC turbine accelerates to provide a specified <br />pump flow. As the RCIC flow increases, the turbine control valve (El IS:FCV] is automatically adjusted to <br />maintain the required design flow. <br />RCIC is required to be operable during Modes 1, 2 and 3 with reactor steam dome pressure > 150 psig, <br />since RCIC is the primary non-emergency core cooling system water source for core cooling when the <br />RPV is isolated and pressurized. <br />RCIC-AOV-PCV23 is a 1" pressure controlled globe valve located on the RCIC pump discharge line to <br />the RCIC lube oil cooler. This valve has an air operated actuator which regulates the pressure of the <br />cooling water based on the output of its controller, RCIC-PC-23. The valve works as a pressure <br />reducing orifice to maintain the pressure in the lube oil cooling line below 60 psig to prevent over <br />pressurizing the cooling circuit. Upon a loss of air to the valve operator a spring within the actuator will <br />force the valve open. The actuator includes a travel stop, which is designed to prevent over-<br />pressurization of the cooling circuit by limiting the distance the valve can open. <br />EVENT DESCRIPTION <br />On November 8, 2016, at 11:27 hours, CNS Operators declared RCIC inoperable for surveillance testing <br />and entered Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.5.3, Condition A. <br />Subsequently at 11:41 hours, Operations declared RCIC inoperable due to a water leak from the lube oiler <br />cooler lower flange. <br />During investigation it was determined that valve RCIC-AOV-PCV23, which was replaced during Refueling <br />Outage 29, was full open causing excessive cooling water pressure to the lube oil cooler. Initial <br />examination revealed that the actuator was supplied with a.closed travel stop instead of the required open <br />travel stop. This travel stop prevents over-pressurization of the cooling circuit by limiting the opening <br />stroke distance of RCIC-AOV-PCV23. The purchase order for the replacement valve and actuator did not <br />contain a part description stating a travel stop was required. <br />YEAR <br />2016 <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />- 008 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />-00 <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016) <br />1.

Send <br />comments regarding burden estimate to the FOIA, Privacy and Information Collections Branch <br />(T-5 F53), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, or by e-mail to <br />Infocollects.Resource@nrc.gov, and to the Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory <br />Affairs, NEOB-10202, (3150-0104), Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503. If a <br />means used to impose an information collection does not display a currently valid OMB control <br />number, the NRC may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, the <br />information collection. <br />NARRATIVE <br />The work order was revised to fabricate and install an open travel stop. On November 10, 2016, following <br />valve modification, RCIC passed surveillance testing, was declared operable, and TS LCO 3.5.3, Condition <br />A, was exited. <br />BASIS FOR REPORT <br />This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as any operation or condition which <br />was prohibited by Technical Specifications, because RCIC was inoperable during the entry into the <br />Mode of Applicability. <br />SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE <br />There were no actual safety consequences associated with this event. The potential safety consequences <br />of this event were minimal due to the limited duration the condition existed and all Emergency Core <br />Cooling Systems remained operable or available throughout the event. The RCIC system is designed to <br />inject water into the reactor vessel during isolated conditions and is not considered an Emergency Core <br />Cooling System. The total duration of inoperability, including the time prior to discovery of the condition <br />was less than the 14 day Technical Specification Completion Time. During the time period of inoperability, <br />Emergency Core Cooling Systems (High Pressure Coolant Injection, Automatic Depressurization System, <br />Core Spray, and Low Pressure Coolant Injection) were operable or available and would have adequately <br />responded to reactor vessel isolation and design basis events. <br />CAUSE <br />The root cause evaluation determined that the correct air operated valve was not purchased because the <br />material master purchase order text and associated drawing didn't detail the requirement of an open <br />travel stop. <br />CORRECTIVE ACTIONS <br />To prevent recurrence, CNS will revise the material master purchase order text to state that the valve <br />includes a travel stop in the open direction to limit valve travel. In addition, the drawing will be modified <br />to show the correct travel stop with a note emphasizing the design function of the travel stop. <br />PREVIOUS EVENTS <br />There have been no events reported in the past three years related to RCIC being declared inoperable. <br />Page 3 of 3 <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016)<br /></span>
