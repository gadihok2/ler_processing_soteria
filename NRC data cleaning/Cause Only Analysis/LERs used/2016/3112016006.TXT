As expected, the 21, 22 and 23 Auxiliary <br />Feedwater (AFW) pumps started on low steam generator level following the unit trip. Unit 2 was stabilized in Mode 3 at normal <br />operating temperature and pressure with the 22, 23 and 24 RCPs in-service. <br />The trip of the 21 RCP was caused by a Service Water (SW) leak that developed on the 22 Containment Fan Coil Unit (CFCU) motor <br />cooler. The SW leaked on to the 21 RCP motor lead containment penetration and the motor leads in the termination box. This <br />caused the A and C phase instantaneous overload relays to actuate causing the trip of the RCP and the subsequent reactor trip on <br />low flow in one reactor coolant loop. <br />This report is being made in accordance with 10CFR50.73 (a)(2)(iv)(A), "Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic <br />actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B)," for this event actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) <br />and the Auxiliary Feedwater System (AF). <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150.0104 	 EXPIRES: 0113112018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours. <br />Reported lessons learned are incorporated into the licensing process and fed back to <br />industry.

This caused <br />the A and C phase instantaneous overload relays to actuate causing the trip of the RCP and the subsequent reactor trip on low flow in <br />one reactor coolant loop. <br />This report is being made in accordance with 10CFR50.73 (a)(2)(iv)(A), "Any event or condition that resulted in manual or automatic <br />actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (a)(2)(iv)(B)," for this event actuation of the Reactor Protection System (RPS) and <br />the Auxiliary Feedwater System (AF)." <br />CAUSE OF EVENT <br />The trip of the 21 RCP was caused by a Service Water (SW) leak that developed on the 22 Containment Fan Coil Unit (CFCU) motor <br />cooler. The SW leaked on to the 21 RCP motor lead containment penetration and the motor leads in the termination box. This caused <br />the A and C phase instantaneous overload relays to actuate causing the trip of the RCP and the subsequent reactor trip on low flow in <br />one reactor coolant loop. <br />SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS <br />A reactor coolant pump trip ultimately causing a reactor trip at power is an analyzed condition. The reactor coolant mass flow rate <br />required for at-power operation is assumed to be provided by four reactor coolant pumps. Lower mass flow rate at 100% power <br />would negatively affect the Departure from Nucleate Boiling Ratio assumed in core design. However, satisfactory margin exists to <br />preclude DNB by the initiation of a reactor trip on a reactor coolant pump trip. <br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(11-2015) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 01/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours. <br />Reported lessons learned are incorporated into the licensing process and fed back to <br />industry.

LER NUMBER <br />SEQUENTIAL 	 REVISION <br />NUMBER 	 NUMBER <br />2016 	 006 	 000 <br />Salem Generating Station — Unit 2 05000311 <br />YEAR <br />3 OF 3 <br />NARRATIVE <br />The Reactor Protection System is designed such that at greater than 36% Rated Thermal Power (RTP), a low flow condition <br />sensed in one of four reactor coolant loops will trip the reactor. This safety feature worked to trip the reactor on 8/31/16. UFSAR <br />Section 15 considers a partial loss of flow at power to be a condition II event (Fault of Moderate Frequency). At worst, these faults <br />result in the reactor shutdown with the plant being capable of returning to operation. By definition, these faults (or events) do not <br />propagate to cause a more serious fault, i.e. Condition III or IV category. In addition, Condition II events are not expected to result <br />in fuel rod failures or Reactor Coolant System {RCS) over-pressurization. The condition II event is analyzed for the worst case <br />condition of 100% power with a loss of flow in two reactor coolant loops. <br />A SW leak from a CFCU inside containment is also an analyzed condition. The approximately 50 gallon per minute leak <br />experienced on 8/31/16 is well within a containment sump pump volumetric flow rate limit. <br />SAFETY SYSTEM FUNCTIONAL FAILURE <br />This condition did not result in a safety system functional failure as defined in NEI 99-02, Regulatory Assessment Performance <br />Indicator Guidelines. This event did not result in a condition that would have prevented the fulfillment of a safety function of a system <br />needed to shut down the reactor and maintain it in a safe shutdown condition, remove residual heat, control the release of radioactive <br />material, or mitigate the consequences of an accident. <br />PREVIOUS EVENTS <br />A review of previous events for the past three years did not identify any similar events. <br />CORRECTIVE ACTIONS <br />The RCP leads and the penetration termination box were repaired. <br />As an extent of condition review, 18 penetrations in the area of the SW leak were inspected for water damage. No penetrations or <br />electrical termination boxes other than those for the 21 RCP motor leads penetration were found to have sustained damage from <br />the SW leak. <br />The 22 CFCU motor cooler was repaired and a failure analysis performed to determine the cause of the motor cooler gasket failure <br />that was the source of the leak. <br />The surveillance procedure for SW to CFCUs that was being performed at the time of the leak was revised for both units. <br />Additional procedures related to restoration of SW to CFCUs will be evaluated for potential improvements. <br />Equipment operation and maintenance improvements that will minimize leaks in the SW system inside containment will be identified <br />and process through the Plant Health Committee for implementation. <br />Commitments <br />There are no regulatory commitments contained in this LER.<br /></span>
