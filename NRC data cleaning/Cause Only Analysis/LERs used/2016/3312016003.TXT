The cause was determined to be a failure to perform periodic internal inspections of the <br />MSIVs and a non-optimal valve design for the steam line drain application. Corrective actions <br />included reworking CV-4415 to restore its leakage limit to below TS limits. Corrective actions are <br />planned to replace MO-4424 with an optimal valve design. This event was of low safety <br />significance had no impact on public health or safety.

Description of Event: <br />On October 18, 2016, with the unit shutdown for a planned refueling outage (Mode 5, <br />Refueling, 0% power), an evaluation of data from the scheduled Main Steam Line Isolation <br />Valve (MSIV) (System Code SB) and Main Steam Line Drain valve penetration Local Leak <br />Rate Testing (LLRT) determined the 'as found' maximum pathway leakage for the 'B' <br />Inboard MSIV, CV-4415, and the Outboard Main Steam Line Drain valve, MO-4424, in <br />excess of the Technical Specification (TS) 3.6.1.3 leakage limit of 5 100 scfh for a single <br />MSIV and 5 200 scfh for combined pathway leakage. <br />II. Assessment of Safety Consequences: <br />Reportability Evaluation  <br />CV-4415 'as found' leakage was measured at 253.8 scfh. TS Surveillance (SR) <br />3.6.1.3.9 requires verification of leakage rate through each MSIV is 5_ 100 scfh and <br />that the combined maximum pathway leakage rate for all four main steam lines is 5 <br />200 scfh when tested at ?. 24 psig. Failure to meet this SR requires entry into LCO <br />3.6.1.3.9, Condition D, restore leakage to within limits within 8 hours, or be in MODE <br />3 within 12 hours. The as found results exceeded the TS SR limit for individual and <br />combined MSIV leakage and is reportable as a condition prohibited by TS and <br />requires a Licensed Event Report (LER) to be submitted under <br />10CFR50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). <br />MO-4424 'as found' leakage was measured at 710 scfh. As stated in Updated Final <br />Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) Section 6.7.1, the total main steam pathway, which <br />includes the four main steam lines and the inboard MSIV Drain Line, is limited to 200 <br />scfh (i.e., the main steam line drains are included in the total leakage limit for all <br />MSIVs). Therefore, the Main Steam Line Drains valve LLRT failures are included in <br />this LER. <br />Safety Significance <br />The Main Steam system conducts steam from the reactor vessel through the primary <br />containment to the main turbine. In performing this function, it serves as part of the <br />primary boundary to prevent radioactive release to the surrounding environment. <br />Duane Arnold Energy Center 05000-331 <br />NRC FORM 366A (02-2014) <br />1.

DOCKET <br />Duane Arnold Energy Center 3 OF 4 05000-331 <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER YEAR <br />REV <br />NO. <br />2016 - 003 - 00 <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(02-2014) 	 LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />NARRATIVE <br />The MSIV Leakage Treatment Path is designed to mitigate the release of fission <br />products following a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA). This is accomplished by <br />directing any leakage past closed MSIVs and closed Main Steam drain line isolation <br />valves to the main condenser via the Main Steam drain line. The volume and surface <br />area of the condenser provides holdup time and plate-out surface for fission products. <br />Pathways to other systems connected to the Main Steam system are isolated to <br />ensure leakage is processed through this path. <br />The NRC has previously assessed the consequences of BWR main steam line <br />releases. In a paper published in 2002 (PRAB-02-01, "Assessment of BWR Main <br />Steam Line Release Consequences"), the NRC determined an MSIV leakage rate <br />that would be considered risk-significant and would warrant further investigation. This <br />assessment is conservative since benefits of holdup time, plate-out, and gravitational <br />settling are ignored. Given a greater than 20 factor of conservatism, the report <br />concludes there should be no regulatory concern if the leakage past the best sealing <br />valve in any single main steam line is less than 10,000 scfh. This result is reflected in <br />the NRC's Inspection Manual Chapter 0609, Appendix H where a simple probabilistic <br />risk framework is provided for use in identifying potentially significant findings related <br />to containment integrity. <br />The as-found leakage rate in both the B' Main Steam line and in the Main Steam Line <br />Drain line is well below the 10,000 scfh criterion. Therefore, this event was of low <br />safety significance and had no impact on public health or safety. <br />This event did not result in a SSFF. <br />III. Cause of Event: <br />A Root Cause Evaluation (RCE) was completed. The RCE determined that the cause <br />for the `13' MSIV failure was failure to perform periodic internal inspections of the <br />MSIVs and the cause for the outboard MSL Drain valve was a non-optimal valve <br />design for steam line drain application. <br />IV. Corrective Actions: <br />Immediate Corrective Action  <br />CV-4415 internals were re-machined to restore its leakage to below TS limits. <br />The MSL Drain penetration pathway was isolated in accordance with TS 3.6.1.3. <br />NRC FORM 366A (02-2014) <br />1.
