The sodium <br />pentaborate concentration had been measured in response to the receipt of the SLC storage tank high level alarm. The demineralized <br />water isolation valves that could cause a dilution of the tank were verified to be closed. Actions were initiated to add sodium <br />pentaborate to the SLC storage tank to raise the concentration. SLC was declared operable at 1935 EDT following a measurement that <br />verified that sodium pentaborate concentration had been restored to within the TS requirements. The cause of the event was determined <br />to be leak-by of the demineralized water isolation valves that had caused an increase in SLC storage tank level and, therefore, a decrease <br />in sodium pentaborate concentration. The leak-by had been occurring for some time and had gone undetected. The cause of the leak-by <br />not being detected was determined to be inadequate system monitoring. Corrective actions were completed to replace the demineralized <br />water isolation valves and revise the chemistry specification to clearly specify action levels for the tank level and sodium pentaborate <br />concentration and provide margin to the TS limits. Corrective actions were also completed to revise the SLC system monitoring plan to <br />incorporate trending of tank level and boron concentration. The safety significance of this event is very low and the event did not pose <br />a threat to the health and safety of the public or plant personnel. There were no radiological releases associated with this event. <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016) <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(06-2016) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

The MCR and local level indications <br />[[LI]] both were above the high SLC storage tank level alarm [[LA]] setpoint. Operators verified SLC storage tank <br />demineralized water isolation valves [[V]] were closed per the Alarm Response Procedure (ARP). The SLC storage tank <br />was then manually measured to confirm level indication at 1214 EDT. The measured level was below the high SLC <br />storage tank level alarm setpoint. A chemistry sample of the SLC storage tank to determine the sodium pentaborate <br />concentration was requested. In order to ensure a representative sample of the SLC storage tank, sparging of the SLC <br />storage tank was begun at 1340 EDT. In accordance with plant procedures, SLC is considered inoperable during the <br />sparging process and, therefore, Technical Specification (TS) Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.1.7, "Standby <br />Liquid Control (SLC) System," Condition B was entered for two SLC subsystems inoperable. Required Action B.1 to <br />restore one SLC subsystem has a Completion Time of 8 hours. Sparging was completed at 1404 EDT (i.e. 24 minutes <br />after entering LCO 3.1.7 Condition B) and the SLC system was declared OPERABLE. <br />At 1500 EDT, the results of the chemistry sample of the SLC storage tank were obtained and indicated that the sodium <br />pentaborate concentration was 8.3%. Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.1.7.5 requires the concentration to be within the <br />limits of Figure 3.1.7-1. 	 For the SLC storage tank level at the time of the event (i.e. near the high level alarm setpoint), the <br />sodium pentaborate concentration was required to be in the range from 8.5% to 9.5% (weight percent). As a result, SLC <br />was declared inoperable at 1500 EDT and LCO 3.1.7 Condition B was entered for two SLC subsystems inoperable. A <br />second sample was taken and the results confirmed the previous value of 8.3%. Actions were initiated to add sodium <br />pentaborate to the SLC storage tank to raise the concentration. Subsequent sparging and sampling determined that the <br />sodium pentaborate concentration had been raised to 8.9%. Due to the sodium pentaborate concentration being restored <br />to within the SR 3.1.7.5 requirements, SLC was declared OPERABLE at 1935 EDT (i.e. approximately 4.5 hours after <br />entering LCO 3.1.7 Condition B) and the LCO was exited. The SLC storage tank level was then manually lowered to clear <br />the level alarm per plant procedures. Local level indications and manual measurements confirmed the SLC storage tank <br />level was below the high level alarm setpoint by 2216 EDT. <br />A subsequent review of the event determined that the SLC storage tank level had been slowly increasing over several <br />months due to introduction of water through one or both demineralized water isolation valves that were closed but leaking <br />by. On October 9, a SLC pump and valve operability test was performed, in accordance with SR 3.1.7.7. Following the <br />successful completion of this test, which involved cycling one of the demineralized water isolation valves, the valve leak-by <br />increased as a more substantial increase in SLC storage tank level occurred. This increased leak-by was not detected by <br />Operators until the occurrence of the high level alarm on October 28 as described above. Since the water leaking by the <br />valves was demineralized, dilution of the sodium pentaborate concentration was occurring throughout this time. The <br />frequency of TS SR 3.1.7.5 to determine the sodium pentaborate concentration is monthly.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LER NUMBER <br />YEAR SEQUENTIAL REV <br />05000- NUMBER NO. <br />_011 00 Fermi 2 <br />341 2016 <br />- <br />NARRATIVE <br />performances of this SR prior to this event were on September 15 and October 13 and both resulted in an acceptable <br />sodium pentaborate concentration of 8.7%. It is not possible to establish exactly when the sodium pentaborate decreased <br />below the TS SR 3.1.7.5 limit of 8.5%. However, it is reasonable to assume the concentration decrease was <br />approximately linear which would indicate that the TS SR 3.1.7.5 limit was not met for several days prior to the event on <br />October 28. As described previously, TS LCO 3.1.7 Condition B Required Action B.1 has a Completion Time of 8 hours. <br />If the Completion Time is not met, Condition C has a Required Action C.1 to be in MODE 3 in 12 hours. Since the sum of <br />these two Completion Times is less than one day (i.e. 20 hours), it is reasonable to assume that the condition of the <br />sodium pentaborate concentration not meeting SR 3.1.7.5 lasted longer than allowed by TS. This represents an operation <br />or condition prohibited by the plant TS and is therefore reportable under Title 10 Code of Federal Regulations (10 CFR) <br />50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). There is no corresponding requirement for event notification to the NRC under 10 CFR 50.72. <br />The Fermi 2 Updated Final Safety Analysis Report (UFSAR) states that the SLC system provides a redundant, <br />independent, and different way to bring the nuclear fission reactor to subcriticality and maintain subcriticality as the reactor <br />cools. The SLC system permits an orderly and safe shutdown in the event that control rods cannot be inserted into the <br />reactor core in sufficient number to accomplish shutdown in the normal manner. In addition, the SLC system is also <br />credited for injecting sodium pentaborate into the reactor coolant system after a design basis loss of coolant accident <br />(LOCA) in order to control the pH of Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) water to prevent iodine re-evolution. The <br />SLC system consists of a SLC storage tank, two positive displacement pumps [[P]], two explosive valves, and associated <br />piping and valves used to transfer the borated water from the storage tank to the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) [[RPV]]. <br />Since there is only a single storage tank, conditions affecting the tank impact the operability of both SLC subsystems. <br />As described above, both SLC subsystems were declared inoperable due to the sodium pentaborate concentration being <br />outside of the TS required range. This represents a condition that could have prevented the fulfillment of the safety <br />functions of the SLC system described above. Since the conditions at the time of discovery on October 28 met the <br />reporting criteria of 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v)(A), (C), and (D) as an event or condition that could have prevented the <br />fulfillment of a safety function needed to shut down the reactor and maintain it in a safe shutdown, control the release of <br />radioactive material, or mitigate the consequences of an accident, an 8-hour non-emergency event notification (EN 52331) <br />was made to the NRC. This LER 2016-011 is being reported under the corresponding requirements in 10 CFR 50.73(a) <br />(2)(v)(A), (C), and (D). <br />SIGNIFICANT SAFETY CONSEQUENCES AND IMPLICATIONS <br />As described above, the SLC system performs two different functions: (1) enable safe shutdown in the event that control <br />rods cannot be inserted into the reactor core and (2) lower the pH of ECCS water to prevent iodine re-evolution post- <br />LOCA. The safety consequences and implications of each of these two functions are addressed below. <br />Regarding the first function, the SLC system is a redundant and independent means to control reactivity. A probabilistic <br />risk assessment (PRA) was performed to determine the impact of the SLC unavailability. For a SLC unavailability lasting <br />4 hours (i.e. corresponding to the approximate time of the declared inoperability), the increase in conditional core damage <br />probability (ICCDP) and large early release probability (ICLERP) are 9.4E-10 per year and 9.9E-10 per year, respectively. <br />Increases in ICCDP and ICLERP values of less than 1.0E-06 per year and 1.0E-07 per year, respectively, are considered <br />to be of very low safety significance. As a sensitivity to the duration of the unavailability, a SLC unavailability of <br />approximately 17 days would have had to occur to exceed the ICCDP or ICLERP values associated with very low safety <br />significance. Since the worst-case unavailability is bounded by 15 days due to the known satisfactory concentration on <br />October 13, the event is below the threshold of very low safety significance. In addition to the PRA results, a deterministic <br />evaluation of this function was performed. The minimum boron concentration in TS SR 3.1.7.5 is based on a DTE <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 	 3 	 of 	 5 <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(06-2016) <br />, 	 4, <br />' ' 	 * 	 LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />a. <br />; 	 CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request 80 hours.

LER NUMBER <br />YEAR SEQUENTIAL REV <br />05000- NUMBER NO. <br />_011 00 Fermi 2 <br />341 2016 <br />- <br />NARRATIVE <br />calculation which was performed to meet the Anticipated Transient Without Scram (ATWS) rule. The calculation contains <br />an equivalency formula, consistent with an NRC-approved approach, for determining the sodium pentaborate <br />concentration, B-10 enrichment, and SLC pump flow rate required to meet the rule. These three parameters are all <br />related in that an increase in one parameter can offset a decrease in another parameter. Using this equivalency formula, <br />ATWS rule compliance can be demonstrated for the sodium pentaborate concentration of 8.3% measured during the <br />event even assuming the minimum B-10 enrichment of 65% in TS SR 3.1.7.10 and the minimum SLC pump flow rate of <br />41.2 gallons per minute (gpm) in TS SR 3.1.7.7. Therefore, although the SLC system was declared inoperable due to the <br />low sodium pentaborate concentration, the actual SLC system parameters at the time of event would have ensured the <br />capability to control reactivity in the unlikely event that the control rods could not be inserted. 	 Note also that, during this <br />event, the normal means of reactivity control (i.e. the control rods) was maintained. <br />The post-LOCA function of SLC to control pH is not modeled in the PRA. Therefore, only a deterministic approach was <br />used to determine the safety consequences of the SLC system inoperability related to this function. The DTE calculation <br />for pH assumes a certain minimum mass of sodium pentaborate available for injection. The minimum mass is based on <br />the minimum tank volume and minimum sodium pentaborate concentration allowed by Figure 3.1.7-1 of TS 3.1.7. <br />Although the sodium pentaborate concentration of 8.3% during the event was below the minimum value assumed in the <br />calculation, the volume of solution in the tank at the time was much greater than that assumed in the calculation (i.e. near <br />the high level alarm setpoint). A sensitivity calculation using the approximate volume and concentration at the time of the <br />event results in an available mass of boron that is greater than that assumed in the DTE calculation for post-LOCA pH. <br />The post-LOCA pH calculation assumes the manual injection of SLC is completed within 6 hours after the start of the <br />LOCA. Using the approximate volume at the time of the event and the TS SR 3.1.7.7 minimum flow rate, the available <br />mass of boron could be injected in approximately 75 minutes. Based on this sensitivity, although the SLC system was <br />declared inoperable at the time of the event, the SLC system would have been capable of providing the sodium <br />pentaborate mass required to ensure that post-LOCA pH control was successful. <br />Fermi 2 also has procedural guidance in place for an alternate means of injecting boron using the Standby Feedwater <br />(SBFW) [[SJ]] system. The procedure requires that the SBFW system be capable of supplying water to the RPV and <br />there be adequate water in the Condensate Storage Tank (CST) [[SD]] [[IK]]. Both of these requirements were met <br />during the event such that alternate means of boron injection would have been available. <br />Based on the discussion above, the safety significance of this event is very low and the event did not pose a threat to the <br />health and safety of the public or plant personnel. There were no radiological releases associated with this event. <br />CAUSE OF THE EVENT <br />The cause of the SLC storage tank sodium pentaborate concentration being below TS SR 3.1.7.5 was leak-by of the SLC <br />storage tank demineralized water isolation valves while in their closed position. The increase in SLC storage tank level <br />due to the leak-by of demineralized water diluted the sodium pentaborate solution in the tank. The cause of the <br />unexpected increase in tank level and corresponding decrease in sodium pentaborate concentration going undetected <br />was an inadequate system monitoring plan that did not adequately trend these parameters. <br />Failed components: SLC suction line and SLC storage tank demineralized water supply valves <br />Model number: 3624 (F316) CT, globe valve, 1-inch, stop valve assembly <br />Manufacturer: Rockwell-Edwards Univalve <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 	 4 	 of 	 5 <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(06-2016) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.govireading-rm/doc-collectionsinuregs/staff/sr10221r30  <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 1 0131 /201 8 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request 80 hours.

The <br />chemistry specification for the SLC storage tank was revised on November 24, 2016 to clearly specify action levels for the <br />tank level and sodium pentaborate concentration. The action level for sodium pentaborate concentration is now 9.0%, <br />which is the midpoint of the allowable concentration range in TS Figure 3.1.7-1 to provide additional margin to the TS SR. <br />The SLC system monitoring plan was revised on December 5, 2016 to incorporate trending tank level and sodium <br />pentaborate concentration to prevent a future undetected increase in level and decrease in boron concentration. <br />Department human performance (HU) clock resets were conducted for Chemistry and Operations personnel to <br />communicate lessons learned associated with this event. <br />Although not related to the increase in tank level and corresponding decrease in sodium pentaborate concentration, this <br />event identified a small discrepancy between the MCR and local level indications that resulted in an alarm and the actual <br />measured SLC storage tank level that was below the alarm setpoint as described in the narrative. The discrepancy was <br />determined to be related to calibration. Re-calibration was performed on November 1, 2016 to resolve this issue. <br />PREVIOUS OCCURRENCES <br />A review of previous Fermi 2 LERs did not identify any reportable conditions affecting both SLC subsystems <br />simultaneously. A review of the corrective action program did identify previous occurrences where an increase in SLC <br />storage tank level was identified as resulting in a decrease in sodium pentaborate concentration. However, these <br />occurrences were more than five years ago and none of these occurrences resulted in changes in level and concentration <br />that were significant enough to exceed the TS SR. The corrective actions for one of these events did involve replacing a <br />valve to eliminate potential leak-by of demineralized water into the SLC storage tank, similar to as discussed for this event. <br />However, since these previous occurrences did not indicate a significant decrease in boron concentration, these past <br />occurrences did not indicate a need to immediately replace valves or perform additional trending and therefore would not <br />have been able to prevent the occurrence of this event. <br />NRC FORM 366A (06-2016) 	 Page 	 5 	 of 	 5<br /></span>
