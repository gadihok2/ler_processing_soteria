FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant (JAF) initiated a manual Scram in response to lowering <br />screenwell water level due to frazil ice blockage, and subsequently closed the Main Steam Isolation Valves (MSIV). A post <br />Scram review identified that MSIV 29A0V-8613 closed slowly. On January 26, 2016, testing per ST-1B identified that MSIV <br />29A0V-86C closed slowly. In both cases, the inboard MSIVs performed satisfactorily. <br />Troubleshooting identified that the problem originated in the solenoid valve cluster assemblies (SVCA) and they were <br />replaced and tested successfully. A failure analysis was performed by Exelon PowerLabs on the SVCAs. On February 25, <br />2016, the Exelon PowerLabs analysis concluded that the DC pilot valves, 2950V-86B3 and 2950V-86C3, exhibited slow <br />vent times. Additional corrective actions include changing the preventative maintenance frequency from 8 years to 6 years <br />and initiating further investigation through the component's vendor. <br />Two MSIVs exceeded the closing time of Technical Specification Surveillance Requirement (SR) 3.6.1.3.6. This condition <br />caused two independent channels of a system used to control the release of radioactive material to become inoperable; <br />reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii). <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />Page 2 of 4 <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />	<br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />''G&44 <br />t• 	 LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 <br />	<br />EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request 80 hours.

LER NUMBER <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />— 002 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />— 00 <br />YEAR <br />2016 <br />NARRATIVE <br />Background <br />James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant (JAF) has four main steam lines [El IS identifier: SB] between the <br />reactor and the main turbine [TA]. These lines are designed to isolate in the event of design basis accidents. In <br />the event of a main steam line break, the isolation prevents further radiological release. In the event of a loss <br />of coolant (LOCA) accident, they isolate to maintain coolant inside of containment. <br />Two isolation valves are provided in series in a horizontal run of each main steam line, as close as practical to <br />the primary containment. One inside (inboard) and the other outside (outboard) together form part of the <br />primary containment barrier for Reactor Coolant System breaks inside the containment and part of the Reactor <br />Coolant Pressure Boundary for main steam line breaks outside the primary containment. <br />The closure time of the main steam isolation valves (MSIVs) is a significant variable from a radiological <br />standpoint. The MSIVs are required to close within 3 to 5 seconds after signal generation. The closure speed <br />is designed to be slower than 3 seconds in order to lessen the pressure transient caused by an inadvertent <br />simultaneous closure of all steam lines. The closure speed is designed to be faster than 5 second to minimize <br />the release of fission products to the environment and retain reactor coolant. <br />Each MSIV is controlled by a solenoid 	 I SUPPLY I <br />valve cluster assembly (SVCA). There <br />are three solenoid valves within the 	 AC PILOT 	 2 WAY <br />SVCA; AC Pilot solenoid valve, AC <br />Test solenoid valve and a DC pilot <br />solenoid valve. These three solenoids <br />port air to and from other control 	 TEST 	 3 WAY <br />valves. The normally energized AC pilot <br />valve and DC pilot valve must move to <br />the de-energized position to change the 	 DC 	 PILOT 	 4 WAY <br />position of the 2 and 4 way valves 	 MSIV ACTUATOR <br />which closes the MSIV. When both <br />solenoids are de-energized, the below 	 ♦ NORMAL CLOSED <br />piston operator space is vented. <br />Simultaneously, the above piston operator space is pressurized, thus assisting the spring in closing the MSIV. <br />This licensee event report (LER) addresses a slow closure response for outboard MSIV 29A0V-86B and <br />29A0V-86C due to their DC pilot solenoid valves 2950V-86B3 and 2950V-86C3. <br />Event Description <br />On January 23, 2016, control room Operators inserted a manual Scram due to lowering intake levels resulting <br />from frazil ice conditions in Lake Ontario. As part of the plant shutdown the MSIVs were closed. The closing <br />time for the "B" outboard MSIV 29A0V-86B, was slow by as much as 9 seconds after the other valves <br />indicated closed. The SVCA and 4-way valve were replaced and 29A0V-86B then stroked satisfactorily. <br />On January 27, 2016, the MSIV fast closure test ST-1B was performed on all MSIVs. MSIV 29A0V-86C <br />closed in 6.9 seconds and all other MSIVs tested satisfactorily. The SVCA and 4-way valve were replaced and <br />29A0V-86C then stroked satisfactorily. <br />CLOSED <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />Page 3 of 4 <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />	<br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />''G&44 <br />t• 	 LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 <br />	<br />EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request 80 hours.

LER NUMBER <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />— 002 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />— 00 <br />YEAR <br />2016 <br />Event Analysis <br />On January 27, 2016, 29A0V-86C was taken closed using the slow close push button; the manual control <br />switch was then taken from "Auto-open" to "closed". At this point, Operators released the slow close push <br />button and the expected response was that the valve would remain closed. It temporarily drifted open and then <br />reclosed. This can occur because both the AC and DC solenoids need to deenergize in order to close the <br />MSIVs. If either the AC or DC solenoids stick in their seats the 2-way and 4-way valves would be positioned to <br />port instrument air to the underside of the MSIV actuator piston causing the valve to open. <br />A failure analysis on the SVCA for MSIVs 29A0V-86B and 29A0V-86C was conducted by Exelon PowerLabs <br />and the results were delivered to JAF on February 25, 2016, in report ENT-40072. The only anomaly <br />discovered was that both DC pilots in the SVCAs exhibited slow average vent times of 4.94-seconds for <br />29S0V-86B3 and 1.95-seconds for 29S0V-86C3 instead of an instantaneous actuation. A momentarily 'stuck' <br />AC or DC solenoid could explain an increase in MSIV stroke time. However, the Exelon PowerLabs tests <br />confirm that the AC solenoid consistently stroked to relieve air pressure instantaneously while the DC solenoid <br />exhibited a delay. <br />The slow DC pilot valve responses affected the required closing time in two MSIVs. This condition caused two <br />independent channels of a system used to control the release of radioactive material to become inoperable; <br />reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii). <br />Cause <br />The common cause of the delayed closure of MSIVs 29A0V-86B and 29A0V-86C was "sticking" of DC <br />solenoid valves 29S0V-86B3 and 29S0V-86C3. <br />Similar Events <br />Internal <br />The ST-1B MSIV fast closure testing and results are trended by the 1ST Program. Prior to this event there <br />were two recent instances where MSIV closing time was greater than 5 seconds at JAF. <br />CR-JAF-2014-04335 - Close time on 29A0V-86B was 5.5 seconds during ST-1B testing. The apparent cause <br />was high resistance in an electrical contact for the MSIV pilot closure logic. <br />CR-JAF-2008-01147 - Close time on 29A0V-86C was 43.12 seconds during ST-1B testing. The apparent <br />cause was attributed to contamination introduced through the instrument air system into the 4-way valve. <br />External  <br />Limerick Generating Station, Unit 1, LER-2012-001 — Three MSIVs failed hot closing stroke time due to issues <br />with testing accuracy. <br />Quad Cities Nuclear Power Station, Unit 1, LER-2013-002 — Four outboard MSIVs failed to close within 5 <br />seconds because the actuator seals had degraded due to age and wear. <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />Page 4 of 4 <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />	<br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />t• 	 LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 <br />	<br />EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request 80 hours.

Valve stroke time is required to be short enough to limit the release of <br />radioactive material in accordance with accident analyses. A maximum MSIV closure time of 10.5 seconds <br />would limit the total amount of liquid and steam lost from the primary system to prevent core damage, and this <br />closure time will ensure that any radiological doses are well below the guidelines set forth in 10 CFR 100. <br />This deficiency only affected two outboard MSIVs. In both cases, the inboard MSIVs performed satisfactorily. <br />Therefore, all main steam lines were able to perform their intended safety function to isolate. <br />References <br />• Condition Report: CR-JAF-2016-00263, 29A0V-86B Slow Closure <br />• Condition Report: CR-JAF-2016-00324, 29A0V-86C Slow Closure <br />• Exelon PowerLabs Report: ENT-40072, Failure Analysis on MSIV Solenoid Valve Cluster Assemblies <br />29A0V-86B and 29A0V-86C <br />• FSAR-JAF-4.6, Main Steam Line Isolation Valves <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015)<br /></span>
