EXPECTED <br />SUBMISSION <br />DATE <br />MONTH DAY YEAR <br />ABSTRACT (Limit to 1400 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) <br />On June 2, 2016, St. Lucie Units 1 and 2 were in Mode 1 at 100% power. At 1500 hours FPL declared the containment <br />high range radiation monitors (CHRRMs) inoperable on both Units. FPL determined that the resolution of the-.NRC <br />Information Notice (IN) 97-45 industry Operating Experience (OE) concerning CHRRMs cabling was less than <br />adequate. The assumed CHRRMs design accuracy could not be assured during some postulated design basis <br />accidents due to the errors introduced by thermal induced currents and water intrusion/cable blistering within the <br />associated detectors' cabling, resulting in inoperable CHRRMs. The Technical Specifications (TSs) require pre-<br />planned alternate means for containment radiation monitoring for inoperable CHRRMs; these requirements were not <br />implemented until June 2016. FPL also submitted a TS 6.9.2 Special Report for two channels of inoperable CHRRMs. <br />This legacy event was caused by the inadequate evaluation and improper tracking of actions required to fully close the <br />nonconformance identified in the 1997 Information Notice. CHRRMs are used for information, they are not used to <br />control radioactive releases or mitigate accidents. Their inoperability had no significant impact on the health and safety <br />of the public. <br />FPL plans to replace the CHRRMs cabling susceptible to the phenomenon identified in NRC Information Notice 97-45 <br />and its supplement 1. <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016) <br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(02-2014) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 01/31/2017 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request 80 hours. <br />Reported lessons learned are incorporated into the licensing process and fed back to industry. <br />Send comments regarding burden estimate to the FOIA, Privacy and Information Collections <br />Branch (T-5 F53), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, or by <br />Internet e-mail to Infocollects.Resource@nrc.gov, and to the Desk Officer, Office of Information <br />and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB-10202, (3150-0104), Office of Management and Budget, <br />Washington, DC 20503.

FACILITY NAME 3. PAGE 6. LER NUMBER 2. DOCKET <br />YEAR REV NO. <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />2 OF 4 <br />2016 - 001 	 0 <br />NARRATIVE <br />Description of the Event <br />On June 2, 2016, St. Lucie Units 1 and 2 were in Mode 1 at 100% power. As discussed in the NRC design basis <br />inspection report 05000335/2016010 and 05000389/2016010, FPL's 1997 evaluation of previous containment <br />high range radiation monitor (CHRRM) [ElISAL:RM] industry Operating Experience (OE) had incorrectly <br />evaluated the impact of thermally induced currents (TIC) and moisture intrusion/cable blistering on <br />Rockbes,tos/Raychem coaxial cable [EllS:IL:CBL1] and their effect on CHRRMs operability. At 1500 hours; FPL <br />declared the CHRRMs inoperable and entered the appropriate action statements for each Unit. The limiting <br />condition for operation (LCO) for Technical Specification (TS) 3.3.3.1, Action b, Table 3.3-6, Action 15 (Unit 1) <br />and Action 27 (Unit 2), are essentially the same and state that: <br />"With the number of channels OPERABLE [OPERABLE Channels — Unit 2] less than required by the <br />Minimum Channels OPERABLE requirement, either restore the inoperable Channel(s) to OPERABLE <br />status within 72 hours, or: <br />1) Initiate the preplanned alternate method of monitoring the appropriate parameter(s), and <br />2) Prepare and submit a Special Report to the Commission pursuant to Specification 6.9.2 within 14 days <br />following the event outlining the action taken, the cause of the inoperability and the plans and <br />schedule for restoring the system to OPERABLE status." <br />On June 4, 2016 the preplanned alternate methods for monitoring containment radiation levels were <br />implemented in accordance with operator night orders and enhancements made to plant procedure EPG-08, <br />"Monitoring Plant Equipment Important to the Radiological Emergency Plan," Attachment 2, "Alternate <br />Monitoring Method with the CHRRM Channels Inoperable." <br />The CHRRMs are used as one of several diverse methods for evaluating emergency action levels (EALs) for the <br />Loss of Fuel Clad Barrier and for the Potential Loss of Primary Containment Barrier in the St. Lucie Emergency <br />Plan (EPlan). Unit differences necessitate different strategies for the Loss of Fuel Clad Barrier EAL determined <br />by CHRRMs indication. These preplanned alternate methods use: <br />• the containment isolation radiation monitors (Unit 1), or <br />• the diverse indications as defined in the EAL table to evaluate the loss of the fuel clad barrier (Unit 2) (e.g. <br />core exit thermocouples, Dose Equivalent 1-131, loss of the core heat removal safety function and entry into <br />emergency operating procedure EOP-15) <br />The Potential Loss of Primary Containment Barrier EAL determined by CHRRMs indication will be provided in <br />part by the use of the post-LOCA radiation monitors with outside containment radiation levels that correlate to <br />the radiation levels inside containment. <br />Two inoperable CHRRMs require that the NRC be notified of this condition in accordance with TS 6.9.2. FPL <br />submitted the special report on July 16, 2016, in FPL letter L-2016-127. <br />Cause of the Event <br />In 1997 and 1998, NRC Information Notice (IN) 97-45 and its supplement 1 notified the industry that the <br />CHRRMs were subject to erratic behavior and possible failure because the expected post-accident <br />environmental conditions within containment could adversely affect the cabling system. FPL's initial disposition <br />of the issue considered the CHRRMs operable due to the short time period the effects lasted, the bounded <br />containment LOCA temperature profiles, and the consideration of the diverse means available for accomplishing <br />post-accident dose assessment, core damage assessment, and emergency plan (EPlan) actions.

However, this intent was not effectively followed through by FPL and the <br />associated tracking action was inappropriately closed by utility personnel. Failure to appropriately track actions <br />to restore compliance is considered a 1997 legacy issue; the corrective action program (CAP) requirements for <br />operability/functionality have been significantly enhanced in the intervening years. FPL plans to replace the <br />subject cabling with alternates resistant to the effects noted in the IN. <br />Analysis of the Event <br />This event is reportable under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as "Any operation or condition which was prohibited by <br />the plant's Technical Specifications..." The CHRRMs are designed for accuracy within a factor of 2 over the <br />entire range for post-accident monitoring. However, this design requirement would not have been met during <br />postulated design basis accidents (DBAs). From 1997 until June 2016, this noncompliance resulted in <br />inoperable CHRRMs without the implementation of the required TS pre-planned alternate containment radiation <br />monitoring methods. <br />The Rockbestos/Raychem coaxial cabling used with the CHHRM detectors in containment is susceptible to the <br />TIC phenomenon that can introduce transient signal errors in excess of the system's design factor of 2 accuracy <br />requirement during short duration large temperature transients, such as those anticipated following a design <br />basis main steam line break (MSLB) inside containment or loss of coolant accident (LOCA). These transient <br />signal errors are directly proportional to the rate of temperature change (positive and negative) and are only <br />functionally significant in the initial seconds to minutes of a DBA. ,The TIC error induced during the initial <br />temperature ramp of some DBAs was calculated to be in excess of 6000 Rem/hr, and quickly decayed to near <br />zero within the first 100 seconds. As the containment cools down post-DBA, the error response will transition to <br />a negative bias. For St. Lucie, the negative bias is expected to be less than -60 Rem/hr at 500 seconds to -8.5 <br />Rem/hr at 3500 seconds. <br />Cable moisture intrasion/blistering and other phenomenon described in IN 97-45 are driven in part from the <br />temperature peak inside containment, and could lead to a permanent signal bias or cable failure. <br />FPL performed an extent of condition by reviewing the other radiation monitors at St. Lucie for susceptibility to <br />the effects noted in the IN, and no other components relied for long-term post-accident monitoring' were <br />identified. <br />Safety Significance <br />There are no automatic functions provided by CHRRMs on either Unit other than annunciation. The CHRRMs <br />are one of the methods utilized in the St. Lucie Emergency Plan to determine EAL entry conditions, dose <br />assessment, and core damage assessment. <br />Although the postulated TIC signal error in the first 100 seconds post-DBA results in indicated radiation levels <br />inside containment meeting  the EPlan EALs for both the Loss of Fuel Clad and the Potential Loss of <br />Containment, that early in the event there would be no confirmatory evidence to support escalation of the <br />emergency classification beyond the Alert Level. Based on emergency procedure sequence and licensed <br />Operator training for event diagnosis and response, it is considered highly improbable that Operations would <br />declare a Site Area Emergency based solely on the application of the initial containment radiation spike within <br />the Fission Product Barrier EALs. <br />During the postulated post-DBA containment cooldown, the magnitude of the negative bias introduced by the <br />TIC would be overcome by the actual radiation levels in containment, should fuel damage occur. After <br />approximately one hour, the magnitude of the negative bias is insignificant as compared with any substantive <br />accident dose. In addition, during a DBA with fuel damage, diverse indication for entry into higher EALs which <br />are proceduralized and trained upon would result in licensed operators and members of the Emergency <br />Response Organization to make the correct emergency declaration. <br />St. Lucie Unit 1 05000335 3 OF 4 <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />(06-2016) <br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />1.

DOCKET <br />YEAR REV NO. <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />2016 - 001 	 0 <br />NARRATIVE <br />Moisture instrusion/cable blistering is a concern during the higher peak temperatures inside containment <br />associated with DBAs. FPL originally concluded that this was not a concern because of the assumption that the <br />phenomon would only occur at the higher temperatures associated with MSLB. However, the lower <br />temperatures associated with LOCAs do not preclude this degradation mechanism and could result in a long-<br />term erroneous signal bias. <br />Regardless, the diverse indications as defined in the EAL tables to evaluate the loss of the fuel clad barrier are <br />also available and provide information on the health of the fuel clad barrier. These pre-existing diverse indication <br />independent from CHRRMs include the core exit thermocouples, dose equivalent 1-131, loss of the core heat <br />removal safety function, and entry into the emergency operating procedure Safety Function Staus Checks. <br />In addition to directing EPlan EAL entry conditions as described above, the CHRRMs also support Emergency <br />Preparedness dose and core damage assessment capabilities. However, dose and core damage assessment <br />continue to be functional without reliance on CHRRMs as the pre-existing procedures and training for members <br />of the Emergency Response Organization and Operations provide diverse means (i.e., core exit thermocouples, <br />reactor vessel water level monitoring system, reactor coolant system activity, and safety function status checks) <br />for obtaining the required information. <br />Even though the CHRRMs were inoperable during of the time period of concern, diverse indication provides <br />similar information. Therefore this event had no significant impact on the health and safety of the public. <br />Corrective Actions <br />1. Alternate pre-planned means for monitoring containment radiation levels were implemented on June 4, <br />2016. <br />2. The 14-day TS Special Report for two inoperable CHRRMs channels was submitted on June 16, 2016. <br />The licensee planned actions listed below have been entered into the site corrective action program. Any <br />changes to the actions will be managed under the corrective action program: <br />3. FPL is conducting constructability reviews inside containment for cable replacement during the next <br />refueling outages. <br />4.
