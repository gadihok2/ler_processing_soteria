The cause of the RTD insulation degradation was <br />accelerated aging due to high temperatures as a result of improper configuration of piping insulation on the RTD <br />during the previous refueling outage. Corrective actions taken include replacing five of the six RCS Hot Leg <br />RTDs. The sixth RTD was determined to be suitable for continued operation and is planned to be replaced during <br />the next Refueling Outage. <br />The Electrical Conductor Seal Assemblies (ECSA) taken from the removed RTDs were evaluated for reuse on <br />replacement RTDs. It was discovered that the Midlock Ferrules were installed backwards on two RTDs during the <br />past refueling outage. The cause was determined to be less than adequate installation instructions. Corrective <br />actions are to revise the Maintenance procedure and implement further training. <br />This event is being reported pursuant to 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B), 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(A), and 10 CFR <br />50.73(a)(2)(vii). <br />NRC FORM 366 (11-2015) <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER 3. LER NUMBER <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />- 004 <br />Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station Unit 1 05000- 	 346 YEAR <br />2016 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />- 01 <br />NARRATIVE <br />Energy Industry Identification System (El IS) codes are identified in the text as [XX]. <br />System Description: <br />At the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station (DBNPS), the Reactor Coolant (RCS) [AB] System has three <br />thermowells on each of the two RC System Hot Legs/Loops, and each thermowell houses one dual-element <br />Resistance Temperature Detector (RTD) [TI]. Of the twelve RTDs, four provide an input to the Reactor <br />Protection System (RPS) [JC], four provide an input to the Post Accident Monitoring (PAM) [IP] System, and <br />the remaining four provide an input to the Non-Nuclear Instrumentation (NNI) [EE]. <br />The RPS initiates a reactor trip to protect against violating the core fuel design limits and the RCS pressure <br />boundary during anticipated operational occurrences. The protection and monitoring systems have been <br />designed to assure safe operation of the reactor. This is achieved by specifying limiting safety system settings <br />in terms of parameters directly monitored by the RPS, as well as the Technical Specification (TS) Limiting <br />Conditions (LCO) for Operation on other reactor system parameters and equipment performance. <br />The PAM instrumentation displays unit variables that provide information required by the control room operators <br />during accident situations. This information provides the necessary support for the operator to take the manual <br />actions for which no automatic control is provided and that are required for safety systems to accomplish their <br />safety functions for Design Basis Events. <br />The NNI provides the required input signals of process variables for the reactor protection, regulating and <br />auxiliary systems. It performs the required process control functions in response to those systems and <br />provides instrumentation for startup, operation, and shutdown of the reactor system under normal and <br />emergency conditions. The NNI performs no TS required functions. <br />The Remote Shutdown System monitoring instrumentation provides the control room operator with sufficient <br />instrumentation to support maintaining the unit in a safe shutdown condition from locations other than the <br />control room. This capability is necessary to protect against the possibility that the control room becomes <br />inaccessible. <br />Technical Specifications: <br />TS LCO 3.3.1 requires four channels of RPS high Reactor Coolant temperature instrumentation be Operable <br />in Modes 1 and 2. Four of the affected RTD elements (one per channel) provide input to the RPS. Each RTD <br />element supports two RPS functions: Reactor Coolant High Temperature and Reactor Coolant Pressure-<br />Temperature. With one RPS channel inoperable, Condition A requires the channel be placed in bypass or <br />trip within one hour. With two channels inoperable, Condition B requires one channel be placed in trip and the <br />second channel be placed in bypass within one hour. If the Required Action and associated Completion Time <br />of Condition A or B are not met while in Mode 1, Conditions C and D require the unit be in Mode 3 within 6 <br />hours along with the Control Rod Drive (CRD) trip breakers being opened for the applicable RPS functions. <br />Page 2 of 7 <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

With one channel inoperable, Condition A requires the <br />channel be restored to Operable status in 30 days. If the Required Action and associated Completion time of <br />Condition A are not met, Condition B require actions be initiated in accordance with TS 5.6.5 to submit a Post <br />Accident Monitoring Report within the following 14 days. With two channels inoperable, Condition C requires <br />one channel be restored to Operable status'in 7 days. If the Required Action and associated Completion time <br />of Condition C are not met, Conditions D and E require the unit to be in Mode 3 within 6 hours and in Mode 4 <br />within 12 hours. <br />TS LCO 3.3.18 requires the Remote Shutdown Monitoring Instrumentation Functions be. Operable in Modes <br />1-3. With one or more required Functions inoperable, Condition A requires the Function be restored to <br />Operable status in 30 days. If the Required Action and associated Completion time of Condition A are not <br />met,, Condition B requires the unit to be in Mode 3 within 6 hours and in Mode 4 within 12 hours. The Bases <br />for TS 3.3.18 shows that only one channel of the RC Temperature — Hot Leg is required to fulfill the function. <br />DESCRIPTION OF EVENT: <br />As part of the Steam Generator Replacement Project (SGRP) during the 2014 refueling outage, one of the <br />modifications implemented was the replacement of the six dual-element RCS Hot Leg RTDs and RTD cables. <br />The RTDs were replaced due to thermal aging and obsolescence of parts with functionally equivalent <br />replacements. The arrangement of the twelve RTDs is shown below (all have the prefix of TERC3) and what <br />channel of RPS (1-4) or which train of NNI (X or Y) is served. <br />Loop 1(B) <br />B2 (RPS Ch 1) <br />B5 (PAMS) <br />Loop 2(A) <br />A2 (RPS Ch 4) <br />Al (NNI X) <br />B4 (RPS Ch3) <br />B3 (NNI Y) <br />A4 (RPS Ch 2) <br />A6 (PAMS) <br />B6 (PAMS) <br />B1 (NNI X) <br />A5 (PAMS) <br />A3 (NNI Y) <br />On 10/8/2014 it was identified during system monitoring that temperature indications from TERC3B2, Loop 1 <br />RC Hot Leg temperature, had changed slightly, but remained within allowable tolerances. The instrument <br />was monitored for changes, and its output continued to deviate from the other channels. The instrument was <br />recalibrated as necessary to restore operability. On 7/17/2015, following unsuccessful actions to restore <br />operability, RPS Channel 1 was declared inoperable and placed in bypass until repairs could be made during <br />the next refueling outage, since further repairs were not possible with the plant operating. <br />On 4/5/2016, with the plant in Mode 5 and shutdown for routine refueling activities TERC3B2 was inspected <br />due to the problems previously identified. This inspection identified the RTD wire insulation was severely <br />degraded due to apparent heat damage. All six dual-RTDs on both Reactor Coolant System Hot Legs were <br />inspected and observed to have varying degrees of wire insulation degradation, up to total wastage. <br />Page 3 of 7 <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />0.44.'"°44 <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request 80 hours.

LER NUMBER <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />- 004 <br />Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station Unit 1 05000- 	 346 YEAR <br />2016 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />- 01 <br />1 NARRATIVE <br />DESCRIPTION OF EVENT: (continued) <br />While the RTDs were being removed from the field for, replacement, the Electrical Conductor Seal Assemblies <br />(ECSA) were taken from the removed RTDs and evaluated for potential reuse on the replacement RTDs that <br />required Environmental Qualification (EQ). During removal on 4/23/2016, it was identified that on RTDs <br />TERC3B5 and TERC3A4 (Conax) the Midlock Ferrules had been installed backwards during the previous <br />outage. <br />CAUSE OF EVENT: <br />While analyzing the cause, it was identified that two Engineering Change Packages (ECPs) were developed <br />and implemented to replace the six dual-element RTDs during the Steam Generator Replacement Project <br />(SGRP) in 2014. One ECP was written to support piping insulation removal and re-installation with a new, <br />more effective insulation; and the second ECP was written to support RTD replacement. During comment <br />resolution of the RTD ECP, the EQ Engineer provided comments and statements pertaining to insulation <br />requirements that were not fully addressed and were not ultimately passed on to the engineer responsible for <br />the piping insulation ECP. Additional individual errors were made during ECP development and work order <br />along with post-implementation walkdown. Basic work practice weaknesses resulted in incorrect design <br />development and implementation of the piping insulation for the RTD thermowells. <br />The direct cause of the RTD conductor wiring insulation degradation was accelerated aging due to high <br />temperatures located at the RTD termination head. This wiring degradation was as a result of improper <br />configuration of piping insulation on the RTD extension stem during the previous outage. <br />The apparent cause of the incorrect piping insulation configuration was due to incorrect and insufficient <br />guidance provided in the piping insulation Engineering Change Package. <br />The cause of the backward installation of the Midlock Ferrules on RTDs TERC3B5 and TERC3A4 is that less <br />than adequate instructions were available to support the successful assembly and installation of the Conax <br />ECSAs. <br />ANALYSIS OF EVENT: <br />The wire insulation degradation on the RC Hot Leg RTD, TERC3B2, resulted in the output temperature <br />indication to deviate in the downward direction and thus it was unable to perform its intended function of <br />providing Channel 1 input to the RPS for a High Temperature Trip or a Pressure/Temperature Trip. The RPS <br />High Temperature Trip provides backup protection for RCS overheating events and is not used as the primary <br />trip function for any accident analysis. The RCS Pressure/Temperature Trip is the primary trip for only a RCS <br />letdown line rupture accident. <br />Since the RPS trips associated with these instruments are high temperature trips and the failure mechanism <br />caused by the insulation damage is a failed low condition, the insulation damage would not have resulted in a <br />plant trip or transient, arid therefore would not cause an initiating event, nor the reactor trips associated with <br />those instruments, for mitigating any accidents or transients. <br />Page 4 of 7 <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

LER NUMBER <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />- 004 <br />Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station Unit 1 05000- 	 346 YEAR <br />2016 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />- 01 <br />NARRATIVE <br />ANALYSIS OF EVENT: (continued) <br />The wire insulation degradation on TERC3B2 also resulted in it not being able to provide accurate hot leg <br />temperature input for the Post-Accident Monitoring System and the Auxiliary Shutdown Panel. <br />The three remaining RPS temperature inputs (besides TERC3B2) were still functioning (although degraded), <br />as were other hot leg temperature indications on the Auxiliary Shutdown Panel and the Post-Accident <br />Monitoring System. Since diverse temperature indication remained available, hot leg temperature inputs as <br />part of the decision-making process could still be performed. As such, the wire insulation degradation and the <br />backward installation of the Midlock Ferrules is qualitatively evaluated as having very low safety significance. <br />Reportability Discussion: <br />RTD elements TERC3B2, TERC3A4, TERC3B4, and TERC3A2 provide input to RPS Channels 1 through 4. <br />TERC3B2 had been declared inoperable during the past operating cycle and documented in the Corrective <br />Action Program with appropriate actions taken per TS LCO 3.3.1. The RPS Reactor Coolant High <br />Temperature trip and the RPS Reactor Coolant Pressure-Temperature trip are considered to have been <br />incapable of performing their safety functions during the operating cycle. A minimum of two out of four <br />channels are required to meet T.S. 3.3.1. At least two of the channels were subsequently determined to be <br />inoperable during the operating cycle, resulting in the plant operating in a condition prohibited by the TS due <br />to Actions of TS 3.3.1 not met, therefore, reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). <br />The RPS logic requires at least two channels to generate a protective trip. Since insufficient channels of the <br />RC High Temperature function of the RPS were Operable to ensure the RPS could perform its required safety <br />function at all times (including during testing of channels that would otherwise have been Operable), the RPS <br />would not have been able to perform all required safety functions as a result of this condition. Therefore, this <br />condition is also reportable per 10CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(A) as a condition that could have prevented the <br />fulfillment of the safety function of a system needed to shutdown the reactor and maintain it in a safe <br />shutdown condition. Because the condition with the RC Hot Leg RTDs was found with the reactor defueled, at <br />the time of discovery, these instruments had no safety function. Therefore, this issue was not immediately <br />reportable (within 8 hours) per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v)(A). <br />The improper configuration of the RCS piping insulation installed resulted in multiple independent channels of <br />the RPS to become inoperable. Therefore, 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(vii), an event where a single cause or <br />condition caused two independent channels to become inoperable in a single system designed to (A) shut <br />down the reactor and maintain it in a shutdown condition is documented. <br />Two channels of the PAM RC Outlet Temperature function per RC Loop are required to be Operable, and two <br />channels of the RC Hot Leg Level Wide Range function are required to be Operable. However, one channel <br />of the RC Outlet Temperature function was inoperable in each RC Loop during the operating cycle, and one <br />channel of the RC Hot Leg level was inoperable during the operating cycle. Therefore, the plant operated in a <br />condition prohibited by TS 3.3.17, which is reportable per 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B). <br />Because TERC3A4 remained Operable, TS 3.3.18, Remote Shutdown Monitoring Instrumentation, was met <br />during the operating cycle. <br />Page 5 of 7 <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

This sixth RTD was determined to be suitable for continued operation, and with concurrence from the <br />vendor, this RTD was reinstalled and declared operable. <br />The piping insulation for the six dual element RCS Hot Leg RTDs was modified using two flat insulation <br />halves to satisfy vendor specified insulation configuration for the RTDs and installed during the 2016 <br />Refueling Outage. <br />At the end of the 2016 Refueling Outage with the unit in Mode 3 at normal operating pressure and <br />temperature, Environmental Qualification (EQ) Engineering personnel performed external surface <br />temperature measurements of all six dual element Hot Leg RTDs. Observations by the EQ Engineer <br />concluded, that the piping insulation engineering change was effective at providing sufficient insulation and <br />extension tube cooling length to limit RTD heat rise. <br />The RTDs requiring Environmental Qualification were reinstalled with the Midlock Ferrules correctly oriented <br />prior to restart to provide the qualified seal. <br />The topic of "RCS Hot Leg Temperature RTD Wire Insulation Degradation" was discussed in an Awareness <br />Communication News Flash to engineering personnel. This topic is planned to be discussed in the 2016 <br />continuing engineering training. <br />Scheduled Actions: <br />During the next Refueling Outage scheduled for Spring of 2018, visual inspection of dual element RCS Hot <br />Leg RTD TERC3B2/3B5, installed during the 2016 refueling outage, will be performed to verify no wiring <br />insulation degradation has occurred. <br />RCS Hot Leg RTD TERC3A3/A5 will be replaced during the next Refueling Outage scheduled for Spring of <br />2018. <br />Maintenance procedure, "Installation of Connectors," will be revised to incorporate detailed instructions on <br />how to install the Conax ESCAs (including the Midlock Ferrule), and include specific installation instructions <br />from the vendor manual guidance. Initial and periodic Conax ECSA training was created and added to the <br />maintenance continuing training program. Additional training will be provided prior to the next refueling <br />outage. The ECSAs on the Environmental Qualification packages harsh equipment listings will be assessed <br />for proper assembly. <br />Page 6 of 7 <br />NRC FORM 366A (11-2015) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.
