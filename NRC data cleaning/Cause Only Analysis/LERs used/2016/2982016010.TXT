During the <br />time the detector was impaired, there were no credited compensatory actions taken to ensure Division 1 Core Spray <br />(CS) and Division 1 Residual Heat Removal (RHR) systems were protected from postulated flooding caused by a <br />high-energy line break. As such, it was determined that both Division 1 CS and Division 1 RHR were inoperable for <br />a period greater than allowed by Technical Specifications. <br />The cause was determined to be that when the flooding requirements in the Reactor Building changed, a review of <br />alarm cards did not identify alarm card FP-1/C-4 as needing updated. <br />Alarm card FP-1/C-4 was revised to remove taking radwaste valves out of AUTO for each quad. In addition, the <br />applicable procedure has been revised to ensure actions taken will ensure operability is maintained for <br />environmentally qualified components in each of the Reactor Building quads; and a review of fire panel alarm cards <br />will be performed for similar occurrences where monitoring is the only action taken. <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016) <br />3.

The ECCS uses two independent methods (flooding and spraying) to -cool the <br />core during a LOCA. The ECCS network consists of the High Pressure Cooling Injection (HPCI) System <br />[El IS:BJ], the Core Spray (CS) System [EllS:BM], the Low Pressure Coolant Injection (LPCI),Mode of the <br />Residual Heat Removal (RHR) System [EllS:B0], and the Automatic Depressurization System (ADS). <br />The suppression pool provides the required source of water for the ECCS. The emergency condensate <br />storage tanks (ECSTs) are capable of providing a source of water for the HPCI system. <br />ECCS components located in the four Reactor Building [EIIS:NG] quads are subject to flooding from line <br />breaks such as the steam tunnel feedwater line break. The Technical Specifications (TS) related <br />equipment contained in these quads are: Division 1 CS and Reactor Core Isolation Cooling [EllS:BN] in <br />the Northeast quad; Division 1 RHR in the Northwest quad; Division 2 CS in the Southeast quad, and <br />Division 2 RHR and HPCI in the Southwest quad. Division 2 CS is assumed and evaluated as lost <br />during the 18-inch feedwater flooding event. <br />The Reactor Building floor drain and Torus drain valves [EIIS:V] are designed to close on respective <br />sump hi-hi level conditions to divert water to the Torus area. The Reactor Building floor drain and the <br />Torus drain valve closure are barriers credited in the internal flooding analysis. <br />FP-TD-19-2 causes the following valves to fail closed: <br />RW-A0V-A0767, <br />RW-A0V-A0770, <br />RW-AOV-AO768, <br />RW-AOV-AO771, <br />RW-A0V-A0773, <br />RW-A0V-A0772, <br />Torus Drain to Sump A <br />Reactor Building Drains to Sump A <br />Torus Drain to Sump B <br />Reactor Building Drains to Sump B <br />Reactor Building Drains to Sump C <br />Reactor Building Drains to Sump D <br />EVENT DESCRIPTION <br />On July 11, 2016, at 1430 hours, while performing fire detection systems examination per surveillance <br />procedure, it was identified that detector FP-TD-19-2 would not reset, thus initiating alarm FP-1/C-4, <br />Reactor Building Southeast Quad Zone 19. Per the alarm card, if no fire is detected, and the detectors <br />cannot be reset, the Operator is to place the floor drain valve control switches to OPEN and periodically <br />Page 2 of 4 <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016) <br />1.

As such, Operations placed the Torus area and Reactor Building floor drain valve <br />control switches in the OPEN position and commenced hourly checks of the Reactor Building floor drain <br />sump levels for unusual changes. <br />Detector FP-TD-19-2 was replaced, post work testing completed satisfactory, and the detector was <br />declared unimpaired on July 15, 2016, at 14:32 hours. Additionally, the control switches for the applicable <br />valves were placed to AUTO. <br />It was subsequently determined that by placing the drain valve control switches to OPEN, the automatic <br />flood protection function that is credited in CNS' internal flooding analysis, was defeated. <br />During the time the detector was impaired, there were no compensatory actions taken to ensure Division 1 <br />CS and Division 1 RHR systems were protected from postulated flooding caused by a high-energy line <br />break. As such, it was determined that both Division 1 CS and Division 1 RHR were inoperable for a <br />period greater than allowed by TS 3.5.1, Condition H. <br />BASIS FOR REPORT <br />This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(i)(B) as any operation or condition which <br />was prohibited by the plant's Technical Specifications, and also in accordance with 10.CFR <br />50.73(a)(2)(ix)(A) as any event or condition that as a result of a single cause could have prevented the <br />fulfillment of a safety function for two or more trains or channels that are needed to remove residual heat. <br />SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE <br />The safety significance of this event is low. The Division 1 CS and Division 1 RHR Systems were <br />inoperable for approximately 4 days. In the case of postulated flooding caused by a main feedwater <br />break, Division 2 RHR system and the ADS were available to mitigate the event. This event did not <br />cause an impact to the safety of the general public, nuclear safety, industrial safety, or radiological <br />safety. <br />CAUSE <br />The apparent cause was determined to be that when the flooding requirements in the Reactor Building <br />changed, a review of alarm cards did not identify alarm card FP-1/C-4 as needing updated. <br />Page 3 of 4 <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016) <br />Page 4 of 4 <br />NRC FORM 	 366 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />"'" —" <br />laila<br />comments <br />	<br />1 	 LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />EVIIII ,- 	I 	 (See Page 2 for required number of digits/characters for each block) <br />(See NUREG-1022, R 3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http //www me gov/reading-rm/doc-collectionsinuregs/staff/sr1022/r3/) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request 80 hours <br />Reported lessons learned are incorporated into the licensing process and fed back to industry Send <br />regarding burden estimate to the FOIA, Pnvacy and Information Collections Branch <br />(T-5 F53), U S Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, or by e-mail to <br />Infocollects Resource@nrc gov, and to the Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory <br />Affairs, NEOB-10202, (3150-0104), Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503 If a <br />means used to impose an information collection does not display a currently valid OMB control <br />number, the NRC may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, the <br />information collection <br />1.
