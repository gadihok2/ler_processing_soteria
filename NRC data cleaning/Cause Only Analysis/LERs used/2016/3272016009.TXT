EXPECTED SUBMISSION DATE) NO SUBMISSION <br />DATE <br />ABSTRACT (Limit to 1400 spaces, i.e., approximately 15 single-spaced typewritten lines) <br />On December 30, 2016, at 1307 Eastern Standard Time (EST), with Unit 1 undergoing a reactor startup, control room <br />operators initiated a manual reactor trip due to a control rod misalignment on control rod, H-6. At the time of the event, the <br />reactor was subcritical. The manual reactor trip was initiated because control rod, H-6, did not respond when rods were <br />being withdrawn. All systems functioned as expected following the trip, with all control rods fully inserting into the core. <br />The apparent cause was the site did not incorporate Westinghouse operating experience (OE) associated with mechanical <br />binding of a stationary gripper into site procedures. As a result, site procedures did not have a method to ensure the <br />stationary grippers were not bound during initial rod movement. No hardware concerns existed. Unit 1 was returned to <br />service on December 31, 2016, with no anomalies occurring during startup. <br />Corrective actions include revisions to site procedures to incorporate OE and provide guidance for shutting down the <br />reactor versus a reactor trip. These actions are being tracked in the site's corrective action program. There were no safety <br />consequences as a result of the event. <br />1. FACILITY NAME 2. DOCKET NUMBER 	 3.

Plant Operating Conditions Before the Event <br />At the time of the event, Sequoyah Nuclear Plant (SQN) Unit 1 was in Mode 3 following a refueling <br />outage (U1R21). No inoperable systems, structures, or components contributed to this event. <br />II. Description of Event <br />A. Event Summary: <br />On December 30, 2016, at 1302 Eastern Standard Time (EST), SQN Unit 1 was <br />undergoing a reactor startup by withdrawing control rods [EIIS: AA, ROD] for an approach <br />to criticality following a refueling outage. Unit 1 was not critical at the time the manual <br />reactor trip was initiated. During rod withdrawal, operators monitored both the group step <br />counter position indications and rod position indicator (RPI) indications. At 1305, operators <br />observed that control rod, H-6, did not move on withdrawal of associated Control Bank A. <br />Operators verified both indications did not respond to the rod withdrawal demand. <br />Operators entered Abnormal Operating Procedure (A0P)-C.01, Rod Control Malfunctions. <br />At 1307, operators initiated a manual reactor trip. Unit 1 was maintained in Mode 3. <br />Following the reactor trip, all plant safety related equipment operated as designed, and all <br />control rods fully inserted. Auxiliary feedwater (AFW) [EIIS: BA] was already supplying <br />feedwater to the Steam Generators (SG) [EIIS: SG] however, a feedwater isolation signal <br />occurred, as expected due to plant conditions. No complications were experienced during <br />the reactor trip. <br />Control Bank A contains four rods. A review of plant data showed that during the withdrawal <br />of Control Bank A. three of the four controls rods began to step out as demanded. Control <br />rod, H-6, did not move. During troubleshooting activities Control Bank A was withdrawn and <br />all four Control Bank A rods indicated correct movement. <br />An 8-hour non-emergency event notification (EN 52469) was made to the NRC in <br />accordance with 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(iv)(A), as any event or condition that results in valid <br />actuation of any of the systems listed in paragraph (b)(3)(iv)(B), except when the actuation <br />results from and is part of a pre-planned sequence during testing or reactor operation. This <br />LER documents the reportable event under 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(iv)(A). <br />B. Status of structures, components, or systems that were inoperable at the start of the event <br />and contributed to the event: <br />There were no inoperable structures, components, or systems that contributed to this event. <br />Page 2 of 5 <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(04-2017) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.qov/readinci-rm/doc-collectio n sin ureqs/staff/sr1022/r3/) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 3131/2020 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

The failure mode, mechanism, and effect of each failed component, if known: <br />No failure occurred. <br />H. Operator actions: <br />During a reactor startup, the operating crew identified a control rod misalignment for control rod, <br />H-6. Control rod H-6 indicated (-) 3.5 steps on RPI and (+) 10.5 steps on the group step counter. <br />Upon recognition of a misaligned control rod, the operating team entered AOP-C.01, Rod Control <br />Malfunctions, and manually tripped the reactor as directed per procedure. <br />I. Automatically and manually initiated safety system responses: <br />Following the manual reactor trip, all plant safety systems responded as designed. All controls <br />rods fully inserted as required. Auxiliary feedwater was already in service feeding the steam <br />generators due to plant conditions. A feedwater isolation signal was initiated, as expected. <br />Page 3 of 5 <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(04-2017) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />(See NUREG-1022, R.3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nureos/staff/sr1022/r3/)  <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 <br />	 EXPIRES: 3/31/2020 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours.

Cause of the Event <br />A. Cause of each component or system failure or personnel error: <br />During startup, the stationary gripper of control rod H-6 was mechanically bound during initial <br />control rod latching. Westinghouse provided information that this was a known potential issue <br />during initial control rod movement; however, SQN did not incorporate this operating experience <br />(OE) into site procedures. As a result, SQN procedures did not have a method to ensure the <br />stationary grippers were not bound during initial rod movement. This led to a misaligned rod. <br />B. Cause(s) and circumstances for each human performance related root cause: <br />No human performance issues were identified. <br />IV. 	 Analysis of the Event: <br />Prior to the manual reactor trip, SQN Unit 1 was in Mode 3 following a planned refueling outage. <br />Reactor Coolant System (RCS) [EIIS: AB] pressure and temperature were approximately 2235 <br />pounds per square inch gauge and 548 degrees Fahrenheit. Both the motor driven and the <br />turbine driven AFW pumps, and steam dump valves, and the atmospheric relief valves were <br />available. The plant responded as expected for the conditions of the trip. <br />V. 	 Assessment of Safety Consequences <br />There were no safety consequences as a result of the event. All safety systems functioned as <br />designed during the manual reactor trip and there were no radiation releases due to this event. <br />SQN Unit 1 was not yet critical at the time of this manual reactor trip. The assessment tool used to <br />evaluate risk during startup to the point of reactor criticality is the Equipment Out-of-Service (EGOS) <br />shut down safety model. All defense-in-depth safety requirements evaluated in the SQN shutdown <br />safety model were satisfactorily met at the time of the trip, indicating the overall risk level was low. <br />A. Availability of systems or components that could have performed the same function as the <br />components and systems that failed during the event: <br />No systems or components failed as a result of the manual reactor trip actuation. <br />B. For events that occurred when the reactor was shut down, availability of systems or <br />components needed to shutdown the reactor and maintain safe shutdown conditions, <br />remove residual heat, control the release of radioactive material, or mitigate the <br />consequences of an accident:  <br />Page 4 of 5 <br />NRC FORM 366A 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(04-2017) <br />I .
