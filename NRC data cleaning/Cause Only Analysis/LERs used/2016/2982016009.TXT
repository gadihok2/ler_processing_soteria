The CREFS is a standby system. The instrumentation and controls <br />for the CREFS automatically isolate the normal ventilation intake and initiate action to pressurize the <br />main control room and filter incoming air to minimize the infiltration of radioactive material into the control <br />room environment. <br />The safety related function of CREFS includes a single high efficiency air filtration system for emergency <br />treatment of outside supply air and a Control Room Envelope boundary that limits the inleakage of <br />unfiltered air. The system consists of a prefilter, a high efficiency particulate air filter [EIIS:FLT], an <br />activated charcoal adsorber [EIIS:ADS] section, a supply fan [EIIS:FAN], an emergency booster fan, an <br />exhaust booster fan, and the associated ductwork [EllS:DUCT], valves [EllS:V] or dampers [EIIS:DMP], <br />doors [EllS:DR], barriers, and instrumentation. <br />Technical Specifications (TS) 3.7.4 requires one supply fan to be Operable to support CREFS <br />Operability. <br />EVENT DESCRIPTION <br />On December 7, 2016, at 22:20 hours, a Control Room Operator (Operator) was performing the Division 1 <br />Essential Control Building Ventilation functional test (surveillance procedure). The first step in the <br />procedure directs the Operator to remove the non-essential control building Heating Ventilating Air <br />Conditioning (HVAC) system from service per the operating procedure for the HVAC Control Building. <br />This requires the Operator to place the standby control building supply fan to OFF (SF-C-1A-A or SF-C-<br />1A-B), then place the running control building supply fan to OFF (SF-C-1A-A or SF-C-1A-B). The <br />Operator completed these steps correctly. The next steps are to place the control building recirculation <br />fans RF-C-1A and RF-C-1B to OFF, respectively. The Operator instead turned off the CREFS supply fan <br />SF-C-1A rather than the control building recirculation fan RF-C-1A. Not aware of the error, the Operator <br />proceeded to the next step to turn off RF-C-1B. The Operator determined this step was complete when he <br />noted the CREFS supply fan SF-C-1B was already OFF; although this step directs that RF-C-1B, control <br />building recirculation fan be placed to OFF. <br />Page 2 of 4 <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016) <br />Page 3 of 4 <br />NRC FORM 366 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />(See Page 2 for required number of digits/characters for each block) <br />(See NUREG-1022, R 3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http //www nrc gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1022/r3/) <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request 80 hours <br />Reported lessons learned are incorporated into the licensing process and fed back to industry Send <br />comments regarding burden estimate to the FOIA, Pnvacy and Information Collections Branch <br />(T-5 F53), U S Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, or by e-mail to <br />Infocollects Resource@nrc gov, and to the Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory <br />Affairs, NEOB-10202, (3150-0104), Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503 If a <br />means used to impose an information collection does not display a currently valid OMB control <br />number, the NRC may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, the <br />information collection <br />1.

Cooper Nuclear Station 05000- 	 298 <br />2016 - 009 -00 <br />NARRATIVE <br />During the conduct of surveillance procedure for Division 1 Essential Control Building Ventilation, actions <br />are completed to validate that the non-essential control building ventilation fans will not run while the <br />essential control building ventilation system is running. This is accomplished by attempting to start the <br />control building non-essential ventilation system supply fans and recirculation fans while the essential <br />control building ventilation system is running and verifying that the non-essential fans do not start. <br />The Operator is directed to place the switches for the control building recirculation fans in RUN to check <br />that they do not start. However, during this event, the switches for the recirculation fans were already in <br />RUN, as they were not correctly placed in OFF when the control building non-essential ventilation system <br />was removed from service. The Operator noted these fans were in RUN and that the fans were not <br />running, as displayed by the indicator lights. The Operator proceeded and completed the surveillance <br />procedure and reported to the Control Room Supervisor (CRS) that the surveillance procedure was <br />completed satisfactorily with no issues. <br />Shortly after completion of the surveillance procedure, the CRS noted that the Control Room was <br />becoming warmer and directed the Work Control Operator (WCO) to perform an independent review of the <br />back panel controls that were manipulated during the conduct of the surveillance procedure. The WCO <br />reported to the CRS that both CREFS supply fans were in OFF. The CRS verified the position of the <br />CREFS supply fans and declared CREFS inoperable at 22:40 hours and entered TS Limiting Condition for <br />Operation (LCO) 3.7.4. The CREFS supply fan SF-C-1A was placed in RUN at 22:47 hours, CREFS was <br />declared operable, and the LCO exited. <br />BASIS FOR REPORT <br />This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) as a condition that could have <br />prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to mitigate the <br />consequences of an accident. Event Notification 52416 was made to the Nuclear Regulatory <br />Commission Operations Center. <br />SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE <br />This is a Safety System Functional Failure. <br />The Safety Significance of this event is low. The CREFS was briefly out of service when the running <br />supply fan was turned OFF in error during performance of a Surveillance Procedure. CREFS was restored <br />to service when the supply fan was turned on about 20 minutes after it was inadvertently secured. Both <br />CREFS supply fans were available throughout the event. <br />This event did not cause an impact to the safety of the general public, nuclear safety, industrial safety or <br />radiological safety. <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016) <br />Page 4 of 4 <br />NRC FORM 366 	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />(See Page 2 for required number of digits/characters for each block) <br />(See NUREG-1022, R 3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http //www nrc gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1022/r3/) <br />APPROVED BY OMB NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request 80 hours <br />Reported lessons learned are incorporated into the licensing process and fed back to industry Send <br />comments regarding burden estimate to the FOIA, Pnvacy and Information Collections Branch <br />(T-5 F53), U S Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, or by e-mail to <br />Infocollects Resource@nrc goy, and to the Desk Officer, Office of Information and Regulatory <br />Affairs, NEOB-10202, (3150-0104), Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503 If a <br />means used to impose an information collection does not display a currently valid OMB control <br />number, the NRC may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, the <br />information collection <br />1.

A Gaitronics handset was dropped and contacted the "A" side Automatic <br />Depressurization System (ADS) inhibit switch. This contact was sufficient to move the switch from the <br />AUTO position to the INHIBIT position. The CRS was immediately informed and direction was given to <br />place the switch back to AUTO. The "B" side of the ADS remained operable thus maintaining safety <br />function of the ADS. <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016)<br /></span>
