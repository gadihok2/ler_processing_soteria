The cause of the event was a human performance error <br />associated with verifying the correct installation location of the relay block. The turbine trip <br />resulted in the unplanned inoperability of RCIC, therefore, this condition meets the reporting <br />requirements of 10CFR50.73(a)(2)(v)(D). At 1353 on April 28, 2016, the RCIC turbine was reset <br />and RCIC was declared available. The safety significance of this event was low since all <br />Emergency Core Cooling Systems were operable during the time the RCIC turbine was tripped. <br />NRC FORM 366 (02-2014) <br />NRC FORM 366A <br />	<br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(02-2014) <br />to <br />	  LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />CONTINUATION SHEET <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 01/31/2017 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours. <br />Reported lessons learned are incorporated into the licensing process and fed back to industry. <br />Send comments regarding burden estimate to the FOIA, Privacy and Information Collections <br />Branch (T-5 F53), U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555-0001, or by <br />internet e-mail to Infocollects.Resource@nrc.gov, and to the Desk Officer, Office of Information <br />and Regulatory Affairs, NEOB-10202, (3150-0104), Office of Management and Budget, <br />Washington, DC 20503.

Description of Event: <br />On April 28, 2016, at 0848, while operating at 100% power, with no structures, systems, or <br />components inoperable that contributed to this event, Surveillance Test Procedure (STP) <br />3.3.6.1-28, Reactor Core Isolation Cooling (RCIC) System (System Code BN) Steam Line <br />Flow — High Channel Functional Test was started as part of planned testing. The purpose <br />of STP 3.3.6.1-28 is to demonstrate operability of the Steam Line High Differential <br />Pressure (flow) isolation instruments (PDIS-2441 and PDIS-2442) of the RCIC system. <br />During the performance of the STP, relay blocks are installed to inhibit the RCIC turbine <br />trip associated with the RCIC automatic isolation logic under test. Step 7.3.2, which <br />functional checks PDIS-2442, required the installation of three relay blocks, two associated <br />with the inboard isolation signals and one associated with the turbine trip. During the <br />performance of subsequent steps, the RCIC turbine received an unexpected trip signal <br />and MO-2405, RCIC Trip Throttle Valve closed and Control Room annunciator 1C04C (A-<br />5) RCIC MO-2045 Turbine Trip actuated at 1055. Therefore, at 1055 on April 28, 2016, <br />unplanned Limiting Condition for Operability (LCO), LCO 3.5.3 Condition A, RCIC System <br />Inoperable, was entered. Investigations determined that the relay block for the PDIS-2442 <br />turbine trip signal was placed on the contacts for PDIS-2441. At 1353 on April 28, 2016, <br />the RCIC turbine was reset and RCIC was declared available and LCO 3.5.3 was exited. <br />II. Assessment of Safety Consequences: <br />The safety significance of this event was low. During the time that RCIC was <br />unavailable, all of the Emergency Core Cooling Systems (High Pressure Coolant <br />Injection, Core Spray, and Low Pressure Coolant Injection) that would have initiated <br />in response to an accident or transient were operable. <br />All components and systems actuated as designed due to this event. <br />This event resulted in a Safety System Functional Failure and a Maintenance <br />Preventable Functional Failure under the Maintenance Rule. <br />III. Cause of Event: <br />An Apparent Cause Evaluation (ACE) was completed for this event. The ACE <br />determined that the direct cause of the RCIC turbine trip was the incorrect installation <br />of relay block associated with inhibiting the RCIC turbine trip associated with the <br />RCIC automatic isolation logic under test. <br />Duane Arnold Energy Center <br />NRC FORM 366A (02-2014) <br />1.

Specifically, the use of <br />Concurrent Verification was not consistent with procedural requirements. Contributing <br />to this was inadequate placekeeping. <br />IV. 	 Corrective Actions: <br />Immediate Corrective Action  <br />At 1353 on April 28, 2016, the RCIC turbine was reset and RCIC was declared available <br />and LCO 3.5.3 was exited. <br />On May 6, 2016, a Human Performance Evaluation (NUPE) for the installation of the relay <br />block on the incorrect contacts was completed. <br />On May 10, 2016, a Human Performance Department Clock Reset for the Instrument and <br />Control Maintenance (ICM) department was completed to share lessons learned. <br />Corrective Actions for Cause of Event <br />The cause and contributing causes of this event were addressed by: <br />1. The implementation and tracking of the Management Action Response Checklist <br />(MARC) process for the individuals involved with the installation of the relay in order <br />to improve performance. <br />2. Development of Performance Focus Area for Training (PFAT) in ICM to ensure <br />mastery of concurrent verification including proper placekeeping. <br />3. Development of a Dynamic Learning Activity for 'in cabinet' work to include <br />expectations for concurrent verifications and placekeeping. <br />V. 	 Additional Information: <br />Previous Similar Occurrences:  <br />A review of NextEra Energy Duane Arnold Licensee Event Reports from the previous <br />three years found no other instances of events related to unplanned inoperability of <br />RCIC. <br />NRC FORM 366A (02-2014) <br />1.
