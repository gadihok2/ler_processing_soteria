This caused Shutdown Cooling (SDC) isolation valve RHR-MO-17 to <br />close, which actuated the logic to trip the running 'A' Residual Heat Removal (RHR) pump. <br />Operations declared 'A' RHR SDC subsystem inoperable at 09:24 hours and entered Limiting Condition for Operation <br />(LCO) 3.9.7, Condition A, and Condition C. Alternate Decay Heat Removal remained in service throughout the event. <br />Event Notification 52327 was made to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Operations Center. <br />While SDC was out of service, PCIS-REL-K27 work was completed. SDC was declared operable at 05:30 hours on <br />October 29, 2016, and was placed in service at 18:30 hours, and the LCO was exited. <br />The root cause of the event is that CNS did not identify the risk from mechanical agitation during Primary <br />Containment Isolation System (PCIS) relay installation; therefore, the risk was not adequately evaluated or mitigated. <br />To prevent recurrence, CNS will revise Procedure 0.50.5 to list the relays or other devices which could impact SDC <br />when in service. <br />This is a Safety System Functional Failure. <br />Page 2 of 4 <br />NRC FORM 366 <br />	<br />U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />• <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />(See Page 2 for required number of digits/characters for each block) <br />(See NUREG-1022, R 3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.govireading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/staff/sr1022/r3/)  <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours. <br />Reported lessons learned are incorporated into the licensing process and fed back to industry.

If a <br />means used to impose an information collection does not display a currently valid OMB control <br />number, the NRC may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, the <br />information collection. <br />NARRATIVE <br />PLANT STATUS <br />Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS) was in Mode 5, Refueling, at 0 percent power, at the time of the event. <br />BACKGROUND <br />The safety objective of the Residual Heat Removal (RHR) system [EllS:BO] is to provide core cooling, in <br />conjunction with other Emergency Core Cooling Systems, and to provide containment cooling as <br />required during abnormal operational transients and postulated accidents. The RHR system consists of <br />two heat exchangers [EllS:HX], four main system pumps [EIIS:P], and associated piping, valves [EIIS:V], <br />controls and instrumentation. Irradiated fuel in the shutdown reactor core generates heat during the <br />decay of fission products and increases the temperature of the reactor coolant. The decay heat must be <br />removed to reduce the temperature of the reactor coolant to less than or equal to 212 degreeS <br />Fahrenheit (F) in preparation for performing Refueling or Cold Shutdown maintenance operations, or the <br />decay heat must be removed for maintaining the reactor in Hot Shutdown condition. <br />Shutdown Cooling (SDC) is a subsystem of RHR and is placed in operation during a normal reactor <br />shutdown and cooldown. Reactor Coolant is pumped by the RHR main system pumps from recirculation <br />loop 'A' through the RHR heat exchangers prior to returning to the reactor vessel through connections to <br />their respective recirculation loop. <br />The relays used in the Primary Containment Isolation System (PCIS) logic are model CR120A industrial <br />relays [EllS:RLY] manufactured by General Electric. The CR120A relay has a max voltage rating of 300 <br />volts and is a small multi-circuit AC control relay. The relays are popular due to their small size and long <br />mechanical life. CNS currently performs predictive maintenance plans on the relays to replace the coils <br />on a 10-year frequency. <br />EVENT DESCRIPTION <br />On October 28, 2016, SDC isolation valves RHR-MO-17 and RHR-MO-18 were open with RHR Loop A in <br />RHR SDC flush lineup, with an intention of placing RHR Loop A in SDC. The Alternate Decay Heat <br />Removal (ADHR) system was maintaining Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) and Spent Fuel Pool <br />temperature. <br />Work orders were created to replace twenty-seven PCIS relay coils, including relay coil for PCIS-REL-K27, <br />in Refueling Outage (RE29). During testing after completion of the work order, it was identified that the <br />PCIS-REL-K27 relay did not actuate as expected (delayed response). This led to a revision of the work <br />order to replace the entire relay instead of just a coil replacement. This required more wires to be lifted <br />and the relay to be removed from the DIN rail and replaced. <br />SDC was placed in service at 08:49 hours on October 28, 2016. Subsequently, during replacement of the <br />PCIS-REL-K27 relay, the action of installing a new relay onto the shared plastic DIN rail disturbed the <br />mounting rail in a manner that caused the 1-2 contact of the adjacent relay, PCIS-REL-K30, to open. This <br />caused RHR-MO-17 to close, which actuated the logic to trip the running 'A' RHR pump. Operations <br />declared A RHR SDC subsystems inoperable at 09:24 hours and entered Technical Specification (TS) <br />1. FACILITY NAME <br />Cooper Nuclear Station <br />2.

LER NUMBER <br />05000- 298 Cooper Nuclear Station <br />SEQUENTIAL <br />NUMBER <br />-007 <br />REV <br />NO. <br />-00 <br />YEAR <br />2016 <br />NARRATIVE <br />Limiting Condition for Operation (LCO) 3.9.7, Condition A, Required Action A.1, "Verify an alternate <br />method of decay heat removal is available within 1 hour and once per 24 hours thereafter;" entered TS <br />LCO 3.9.7, Condition C, Required Action C.1, "Verify reactor coolant circulation by an alternate method <br />within 1 hour from discovery of no reactor coolant circulation and once per 12 hours thereafter;" and also <br />entered TS LCO 3.9.7, Condition C, Required Action C.2, "Monitor reactor coolant temperature hourly." <br />ADHR remained in service throughout the event and the plant remained aligned for natural circulation. <br />Spent fuel pool weir temperature monitoring was commenced to verify natural circulation. No increase in <br />RPV temperature was observed and there was no impact to plant operations. <br />While SDC was out of service, PCIS relay K27 work was completed. SDC was declared operable at <br />05:30 hours on October 29, 2016, and TS LCO 3.9.7, Condition A was exited. The plant remained in TS <br />LCO 3.9.7, Condition C, and aligned for Natural Recirculation, until SDC was placed in service-at 18:30 <br />hours on October 29, 2016, at which time TS LCO 3.9.7, Condition C was exited. <br />BASIS FOR REPORT <br />This event is reportable in accordance with 10 CFR 50.73(a)(2)(v)(D) as a condition that could have <br />prevented the fulfillment of the safety function of structures or systems that are needed to remove <br />residual heat. Event Notification 52327 was made to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Operations <br />Center per 10 CFR 50.72(b)(3)(v). <br />SAFETY SIGNIFICANCE <br />This is a Safety System Functional Failure because of the loss of the shutdown cooling function of the <br />RHR system. The plant was in MODE 5 performing refueling activities and conducting an Operations <br />with a Potential for Draining the Reactor Vessel activity. The shutdown cooling function of RHR was <br />required to be operable per TS. The Division 1 RHR system was fully functional except for the isolation <br />of RHR-17MV. During the loss of SDC, decay heat removal was being provided by the ADHR system. <br />The reactor coolant temperature did not change during the event. There were no actual safety <br />consequences associated with this event. The potential safety consequences of this event were minimal <br />due to the limited duration the condition existed and the redundant decay heat removal equipment which <br />remained available. <br />CAUSE <br />The root cause is that CNS did not identify the risk from mechanical agitation during PCIS relay <br />installation; therefore, the risk was not adequately evaluated or mitigated. <br />CORRECTIVE ACTIONS <br />To prevent recurrence, CNS will revise Procedure 0.50.5 to list the relays or other devices which could <br />impact SDC when in service. <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016) <br />Page 4 of 4 <br />NRC FORM 366 <br />	 U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION <br />(11-2015) <br />LICENSEE EVENT REPORT (LER) <br />(See Page 2 for required number of digits/characters for each block) <br />(See NUREG-1022, R 3 for instruction and guidance for completing this form <br />http://www.nrc.govireading-rm/doc-collectionsinuregs/staff/sr10221r31)  <br />APPROVED BY OMB: NO. 3150-0104 <br />	 EXPIRES: 10/31/2018 <br />Estimated burden per response to comply with this mandatory collection request: 80 hours. <br />Reported lessons learned are incorporated into the licensing process and fed back to industry.

LER NUMBER <br />NARRATIVE <br />PREVIOUS EVENTS <br />On May 30, 2015, steam flashing in the SDC line occurred, creating pressure transients that caused <br />RHR-MO-17 and RHR-MO-18 to close. The steam flashing occurred due to temperature in the SDC line <br />being at or near saturation temperature causing localized boiling then void collapse with coolant being <br />drawn from the reactor vessel thru the reactor recirculation system. This event was reported under LER <br />2015-004-00, Isolation of Shutdown Cooling Results in a Loss of Safety Function, dated July 29, 2015. <br />On October 14, 2012, flashing of the hot reactor coolant to steam occurred, causing a pressure spike <br />that exceeded 72 psig. Consequently, RHR-MO-17 and RHR-MO-18 clbsed, isolating the RHR SDC <br />loop. This event was reported under LER 2012-004-00, Isolation of Shutdown Cooling Results in Loss of <br />Safety Function, dated December 6, 2012. <br />NRC FORM 366 (06-2016)<br /></span>
