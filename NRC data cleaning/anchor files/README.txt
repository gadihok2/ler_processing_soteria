anchors_master - JSON file with anchor points generated by randomly sampling about 100 files in HTML format from the 2000s. Similarly, anchor points from the 1980s and 90s were added too, however because they arenâ€™t as extensive and because the anchor optimize method looks at all anchors, the anchors_master_00s will be used for files between 2000 and 2018.
